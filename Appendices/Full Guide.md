### Bonds
Your players can choose one or more bonds from the table below to weave a tapestry of connections between their characters and the ghosts of their pasts. Encourage them to reexamine and grow beyond these memories as they venture through Barovia, informing their interactions with the NPCs and narratives they encounter.

| Bond | Character History |
| :----- | :----- |
| Abuse | One of my siblings was cruel to me as a child. I've forgiven them, but never forgotten. |
| Bitterness | Two warring lords brought devastation to my community. I wish I could show them the cost of their war. |
| Boundaries | I was once pursued by an unrelenting suitor. No one should have to endure what I did. |
| Comparison | My older sibling was burdened by great expectations while I was not. I think they resented me for it. |
| Compassion | Someone tried to steal from me once. Rather than hurting them, I helped them instead. |
| Concern | One of my loved ones left home to seek their fortune. I hope they're staying safe. |
| Corruption | Everyone knows that power corrupts. I've seen how firsthand. |
| Determination | My mentor was one of the few people that believed in me. I'm determined to make them proud. |
| Devastation | Someone once destroyed everything I cared about. I can't understand what could drive someone to such evil. |
| Devotion | I love my family above all else. There's nothing I wouldn't do to protect them. |
| Dignity | People should never be used as a means to an end. I should know. |
| Division | My family was split by a bitter feud. I still hope that they'll reconcile someday. |
| Empathy | I'll never forget the sound my parents made when they learned that my sibling had died. |
| Faith | I know what it's like to be persecuted for what you believe in. I never let it shake my beliefs. |
| Forgiveness | Someone once did me great harm. It was only much later that I learned to forgive them. |
| Gratitude | Someone took me in when I had no one else to turn to. I'll always be grateful. |
| Hope | I lost someone close to me to addiction and vice. I still hope that they'll get better someday. |
| Humility | I've seen what happens when people think they have all the answers. It never turns out well. |
| Judgment | I've seen people cause great harm in the name of faith. They laughed when I called it a sin. |
| Loss | One of my loved ones was stolen away from me. I'm still searching for them. |
| Loyalty | Someone close to me fell onto a dark path. I'd do anything to redeem them. |
| Nostalgia | One of my parents loved to create things. Their work always brought me joy. |
| Oppression | A cruel lord once ruled my community. I'll never forgive the harms he caused to my people. |
| Regret | I once knew someone with grand, ambitious plans. I wish they'd heeded my advice. |
| Responsibility | I watched someone allow their family to come to ruin. I'll never do the same. |
| Romance | Love never dies. It might flicker, but I'll never let it burn out. |
| Secrecy | I once promised someone I'd keep their secrets safe. I intend to do so—no matter the cost. |
### Motivations
If you choose to use the ***Barovian Relics*** adventure hook for one or more players (see **Chapter 3: Running the Game**), have those players choose a core character motivation from the following table.

|d12|Motivation|Relic|
|:---:|:---|:---|
|1|Knowledge| Amber Shard |
|2|Redemption|Angel's Feather|
|3|Family|Wanderer's Scarf|
|4|Inheritance|Dragon's Scale|
|5|Wealth|Electrum Coin|
|6|Healing|Wolf's Tooth|
|7|Duty|Raven's Feather|
|8|Power|Crumpled Page|
|9|Ambition|Tattered Banner|
|10|Faith|Sunrise Medallion|
|11|Harmony|Stone Crest|
|12|Justice|Broken Blade|

Once a player has chosen their core motivation, use the relevant section below to aid that player in developing their character's history and goals.
#### Knowledge—The Amber Shard
A player seeking **knowledge** begins the campaign with the *amber shard*, a small chunk of amber resin mounted on a chain-link cord. The shard is inset with complex, three-dimensional arcane runes. When viewed under the *detect magic* spell, it exudes a strong aura of abjuration magic.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *amber shard* was formerly a part of a dark vestige's amber sarcophagus in the Amber Temple in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, it glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *amber shard* should have strong, vivid reasons to want to unlock its secrets and the magic that it possesses.

***Developments.*** In **Act I, Arc A: Escape From Death House**, the player recognizes Elisabeth Durst's *amber shard* as similar in appearance to their own. In [[Arc H - The Strazni Siblings]], the player recognizes Izek Strazni's *amber shard* in a similar way. In *Act V, Arc U*, Elder Burebis of Soldav can recognize the *amber shard* as a shard of evil taken from the Amber Temple, and the player can recognize the *amber shards* kept by the **shoosuva** and **bodaks** as resembling their own. 

If the player character is reduced to 0 hit points in Barovia while in possession of their *amber shard*, it behaves as described in **Appendix B: The Amber Shards,** offering the player an opportunity to forge a pact with a vestige of the Amber Temple that fits the player character's personality, flaws, and temptations. Upon entering the Amber Temple, the player's *amber shard* glows and tugs in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, guiding the player toward a suitable amber sarcophagus.
#### Redemption—The Angel's Feather
A player seeking **redemption** begins the campaign with the *angel's feather*, a large, snow-white feather. When viewed beneath the light of the morning sun, the feather's barbs glimmer like gold.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *angel's feather* formerly belonged to Lumiel, a **deva** that serves the god Lathander, who is known to his followers as the Morninglord. Lumiel is the true name of the Abbot, who dwells in the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the *angel's feather* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will one day lead them to penance for the sins that they have committed.

***Developments.*** When the players first arrive at the Abbey in **Act IV, Arc N: The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind** or **Act IV, Arc Q: A Bride for Strahd**, the *angel's feather* glimmers and is swept away in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, guiding the player toward the Abbot. The Abbot recognizes the feather as his own, but dismisses its importance.
#### Family—The Wanderer's Scarf
A player seeking **family** begins the campaign with the *wanderer's scarf*, a multicolored scarf woven with complex patterns. The fabric is soft and warm, and is long enough to be worn around the neck or over one's head. When bright sunlight, moonlight, or starlight is allowed to pass through it, the patterns seem to shimmer and twist in eerie and beautiful ways.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *wanderer's scarf* once belonged to a Vistana who left their caravan and settled down to marry the one they loved. The scarf was a parting gift from the caravan's leader—a reminder of the joys that the Vistana had experienced while traveling. When it senses the presence of Death House, the scarf is carried away by a warm, playful breeze, its patterns shifting and turning in the air, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the *wanderer's scarf* should have received the scarf from a beloved family member, and should have strong, vivid reasons to long for a sense of family and belonging.

***Developments.*** When the players first encounter Ezmerelda in **Act IV, Arc M: Strahd's Enemy** or **Act IV, Arc N: The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind**, the *wanderer's scarf* shimmers and is carried away in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, landing at Ezmerelda's feet. Ezmerelda recognizes the scarf and, upon confirming how the player came to inherit it, greets the player as family, calling them "cousin."
#### Inheritance—The Dragon's Scale
A player seeking **inheritance** begins the campaign with the *dragon's scale*, a large silver scale that always feels cold to the touch. A Good-aligned creature that touches the scale feels a fleeting sense of safety, protection, and comfort.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *dragon's scale* formerly belonged to Argynvost, the **adult silver dragon** who founded the Order of the Silver Dragon. The order's headquarters, the mansion of Argynvostholt, can be found in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the scale burns with an icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of the house. While the scale glows in this way, a Good-aligned creature that touches it feels a deep sense of longing, loss, and hope.

The player who possesses the *dragon's scale* should have received the scale from a family member, and should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the scale will one day unlock the secrets of their heritage.

***Developments.*** When the player first encounters Argynvost's shadow in the foyer of Argynvostholt in **Act IV, Arc O: The Beacon of Argynvostholt**, the scale briefly burns cold in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House. Each time the player approaches a manifestation of Argynvost's spirit, the scale burns cold and glows with a bright, silver light in the direction of the manifestation. 

If the player helps to retrieve Argynvost's skull and restore it to his crypt, Argynvost's spirit greets the player warmly, naming them his heir to the legacy of the Order of the Silver Dragon before lighting the beacon of Argynvostholt.
#### Wealth—The Electrum Coin
A player seeking **wealth** begins the campaign with an old, chipped *electrum coin* stamped with the profiled visage of a proud, yet cold-looking nobleman. When seen in a certain light, the nobleman's expression seems to change from a firm, aristocratic sneer to a feral, monstrous snarl.

Unbeknownst to the player, the visage stamped upon the *electrum coin* is the face of Strahd von Zarovich, the undead ruler of Barovia. The coin was minted long ago, but spirited away from Strahd's treasuries by a thief shortly before Barovia was lost to the mists. When it senses the presence of Death House, the coin lands on its edge, then begins rolling across the ground toward the house until it reaches the base of its steps.

The player who possesses the *electrum coin* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the coin first came from a wondrous vault of treasure—a conqueror's hoard—and that, one day, it will lead them to claim riches beyond imagining.

***Developments.*** Any Barovian immediately recognizes the visage stamped upon the coin as Strahd's. If the player shares the coin's story with one of the Vistani of Madam Eva's camp in [[Arc C - Into the Valley]], Sir Godfrey Gwilym in **Act IV, Arc O: The Beacon of Argynvostholt**, or Kasimir Velikov in **Act V, Arc U: The Amber Temple**, they can learn of Strahd's vast hoard of treasure, collected in his days as a conqueror and hidden away in Castle Ravenloft. 

When the player first approaches Strahd's treasury, the coin lands on its edge and rolls as far as it can toward the treasury's entrance, in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House.
#### Healing—The Wolf's Tooth
A player seeking **healing** begins the campaign with a *wolf's tooth* coated with clear resin and mounted on a leather cord. The tooth seems to lengthen and sharpen on nights of the full moon, and calms its wearer's dreams when worn at night.

Unbeknownst to the player, the tooth once belonged to a wolfir—a **werewolf** that served the fey goddess known as the Huntress before her gift of lycanthropy was twisted into a curse. The Huntress's holy place, the Forest Fane, dwells amidst the woodlands of Barovia, silently waiting to be restored. When it senses the presence of Death House, the tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *wolf's tooth* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the tooth is the key to curing a particular wound, malady, or curse that ails them.

***Developments.*** If the player shows the *wolf's tooth* to Kavan in **Act III, Arc K: The Missing Gem** or to Elder Burebis in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the tooth is recognized as an artifact and symbol of the Huntress. When the player first approaches the circle of stones at the Forest Fane in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the tooth lengthens and glows with moonlight as it did upon sensing Death House.
#### Duty—The Raven's Feather
A player seeking **duty** begins the campaign with a *raven's feather*, a small, black feather with soft, downy barbs. When held aloft before a storm, the feather seems to gently tremble, exuding the scent of cold rain and damp earth.

Unbeknownst to the player, the feather once belonged to the **roc** of Mount Ghakis, a servant of the fey goddess known as the Seeker, whose Mountain Fane rests in the shadow of Mount Ghakis in Barovia. The roc once enjoyed disguising itself as a common raven, and shed this feather on one such occasion. When it senses the presence of Death House, the feather is swept away by an unseen and violent wind, the scent of rain and ozone  filling the air, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the *raven's feather* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will always guide them to those who need aid, protection, and comfort.

***Developments.*** If the player shows the *raven's feather* to Madam Eva in [[Arc C - Into the Valley]], she inspects it reverently and returns it to the player, claiming mysteriously that she once knew the bird that shed it.  If the player shows the feather to Urwin Martikov, Danika Martikov, Muriel Vinshaw, or any other member of the Keepers of the Feather, that member grows warmer and friendlier toward that player. 

When the player first enters the circle of standing stones at the Mountain Fane in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the feather trembles and the air around it briefly grows thick with the scent of rain and ozone as it did upon sensing Death House. If the player shows the feather to the Roc of Mount Ghakis after consecrating the Mountain Fane in the same arc, the roc places the tip of its beak against the player's forehead as a sign of gratitude and approval before departing.
#### Power—The Crumpled Page
A player seeking **power** begins the campaign with the *crumpled page*, an old, yellowed page that was torn from its book long ago. The page is written in strange and cryptic arcane runes; those few runes that can be decoded speak of a path that leads to immortality and untold power.

Unbeknownst to the player, the page was taken from the library of Exethanter, a **lich** who dwells in the deepest sanctum of the Amber Temple in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that leads to the house.

The player who possesses the *crumpled page* should have strong, vivid reasons to want to find and claim the power that the page promises.

***Developments.*** When the player first approaches Exethanter's library in **Act V, Arc U: The Amber Temple**, the ink glows with amber light as it did upon sensing Death House, and the runes reshape themselves into a map of Exethanter's chambers and nearby access points. If the player shows the page to Exethanter after restoring his memories in the same arc, Exethanter grows warmer and friendlier toward that player.
#### Ambition—The Tattered Banner
A player seeking **ambition** begins the campaign with the *tattered banner*, an old, ragged red banner bearing the heraldry of a raven in front of a shield. The raven's wings are spread wide, and the shield has the image of a castle's keep engraved into its top. Sometimes, when a Lawful-aligned creature holds the banner, a crimson light seems to glimmer from the peak of the castle's keep, and the sound of soldiers marching can be distantly heard.

Unbeknownst to the player, the banner was once flown by the warlord Strahd von Zarovich in the days before he became a vampire and was trapped within the mists of Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the distant sound of war-drums fills its holder's ears and the banner blows in an unseen wind, pulling toward the house's direction.

The player who possesses the *tattered banner* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the banner was once the sigil of a mighty conqueror—and that, by following in that conqueror's steps, they will one day achieve greatness, glory, and the right to rule.

***Developments.*** When the player first experiences the haunted battlefield north of Berez in **Act V, Arc T: Baba Lysaga's Revenge** or **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the banner flaps in the wind, which echoes with the sound of war-drums. 

If the player shows the banner to the revenant at Tser Falls in [[Arc C - Into the Valley]], Sir Godfrey Gwilym or Sir Vladimir Horngaard in **Act IV, Arc O: The Beacon of Argynvostholt**, or Kasimir Velikov in either **Act V, Arc U: The Amber Temple** or **Act IV, Arc M: Strahd's Enemy**, its appearance is met with revulsion and bitter disgust. 

If the player shows the banner to Strahd, he regards it with fond thoughtfulness, but declines to elaborate on its significance. If the player shows the banner to Dr. Rudolph van Richten in **Arc M: Strahd's Enemy** or any Vistani, they immediately recognize it as the heraldry of Castle Ravenloft.
#### Faith—The Sunrise Medallion
A player seeking **faith** begins the campaign with the *sunrise medallion*, a bronze disc engraved with the image of a rising sun. The disc glitters like gold when exposed to the light of the sunrise, and a Good-aligned creature that touches it feels a fleeting sense of reverence, righteousness, and peace.

Unbeknownst to the player, the medallion once belonged to Sergei von Zarovich, the brother of Strahd von Zarovich and an acolyte of the Church of the Morninglord who was once expected to become its Most High Priest. When it senses the presence of Death House, the medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, the rays of sunlight emanating from the engraved sun pointing in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *sunrise medallion* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that it will strengthen or guide them in faith, and that certain signs of the divine will lead them to those in need of salvation and deliverance.

***Developments.*** When the player first approaches St. Andral's Church in [[Arc D - The Tome of Strahd]], the *sunrise medallion* glows and shines in the direction of the church's doors. If the player shows the *sunrise medallion* to Father Donavich or Lucian, they recognize it as a symbol of the Church of the Morninglord and grow warmer and friendlier toward that player.
#### Harmony—The Stone Crest
A player seeking **harmony** begins the campaign with the *stone crest*, a flat, round stone engraved with the image of a three-pointed star. On the nights of the new moon, the star seems to glimmer with emerald light.

Unbeknownst to the player, the crest once belonged to a spiritual leader among the First Folk, the people who first settled the land of Barovia long ago, and who have now divided into the Forest Folk (who are loyal to Strahd) and the Mountain Folk (who are not). The engravings upon it depict the symbols of the Seeker, the Weaver, and the Huntress—the three fey goddesses that the First Folk once called the *Rozana*, or Ladies Three. When it senses the presence of Death House, the crest emits a low hum and releases a scent of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger as the player approaches the house.

The player who possesses the *stone crest* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the symbols upon it represent a primal or divine power of harmony and nature, and that the crest can aid them in restoring the sanctity of wild places.

***Developments.*** When the player first approaches the exterior of Soldav in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the *stone crest* hums and releases a scent of pine needles and earth soil as it did upon sensing Death House, both of which grow stronger as the player approaches the Shrine of the Rozana in Soldav. 

If the player shows the *stone crest* to Kavan in **Act III, Arc K: The Missing Gem** or to Elder Burebis in **Act V, Arc W: The Ladies of the Fanes**, the crest is recognized as an artifact and symbol of the Ladies of the Fanes. 
#### Justice—The Broken Blade
A player seeking **justice** begins the campaign with the *broken blade*, the shattered tip of an elven longsword. The blade is engraved with the sigil of a lion rampant, which seems to roar when the light of dusk touches it.

Unbeknownst to the player, the blade once belonged to Erevan, a dusk elf prince. Erevan, a master bladesinger, practiced the style of the lion, which he also used as his personal sigil. However, Erevan refused to pay tribute to King Barov von Zarovich, a powerful warlord and the father of Strahd von Zarovich. 

Rahadin, a dusk elf who had spurned Erevan's rule, helped King Barov conquer the dusk elf kingdom. Rahadin then broke Erevan's blade and personally executed Erevan and his family as punishment for his defiance. When it senses the presence of Death House, the blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *broken blade* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that their ancestors were refugees, driven forth from their ancestral lands and persecuted, and that the blade will one day deliver justice to the traitor who destroyed them.

***Developments.*** If the player shows the *broken blade* to Kasimir Velikov in **Act V, Arc U: The Amber Temple**, he mournfully recalls its history and asks the player how they came to possess it. If the player informs Kasimir of how they came to inherit it, Kasimir greets them as family, wondering aloud if more of the dusk elves may have escaped Strahd's slaughter outside of Barovia.

If the *broken blade* is ever in close proximity to Rahadin, Strahd's chamberlain, it emits a high-pitched hum and trembles violently, spinning like a compass needle in his direction just as it did upon sensing Death House. If the player shows the *broken blade* to Rahadin, he at first claims to have no memory of it, noting dispassionately the thousands that he has slaughtered. However, in combat, Rahadin eventually comes to remember the blade's origins, dismissing it as "the shattered toy of a weak and worthless man."
## Session Zero
### Setting Expectations
Welcome to a world shrouded in darkness and horror, where secrets and conspiracies lurk around every corner. In order to fully immerse themselves in this chilling adventure, your players should consider these expectations when crafting their characters and preparing for the campaign:

* ***Tone***. Embrace the dark fantasy setting and create characters with heroic hearts or the potential to grow into true heroes when faced with life-or-death situations. Cooperation and collaboration will be key in this twisted realm.
* ***Theme***. As you explore this gothic horror landscape, prepare to allow your characters to confront their own regrets, traumas, flaws, and fears, enhancing the overall atmosphere and tension of the campaign.
* ***Engagement***. Prepare to delve deep into the rich lore and history of this world. Taking notes and engaging with the story will not only heighten your experience but also benefit your party as you navigate this intricate adventure.
* ***Tactics***. Tread carefully in a land rife with hidden allies and potential enemies. Consider the consequences of your actions and avoid making unnecessary enemies who could hinder your progress.
* ***Roleplay***. Be open to forming meaningful relationships with the unique and intriguing non-player characters that inhabit this world. Emotional investment in these characters will enrich your overall experience.
* ***Difficulty***. Death may lurk around every corner, but with clever thinking and strategic alliances, your party can overcome even the most daunting obstacles.
* ***Rewards***. While material treasures may be scarce, the true rewards of this campaign lie in the allies, information, and story hooks you'll uncover as you complete each harrowing quest. Experience points will be awarded for milestones achieved along the way.
* ***Narrative***. Expect the campaign to begin with a clear path but quickly evolve into an expansive sandbox. Balancing and prioritizing multiple quests will be crucial as you navigate the world's urgent deadlines and far-reaching consequences.
### Triggers & Accommodations
Our aim is to create a memorable and enjoyable gothic horror experience for everyone involved. To that end, it's essential to address any potentially uncomfortable or controversial topics before beginning your *Curse of Strahd* adventure. During Session Zero, we encourage open and honest communication with your players about their personal boundaries and any elements of the campaign that may require modification or removal.
A list of potentially uncomfortable topics you might want to discuss with your players before beginning the campaign includes:

* Child abuse and death (e.g., the Durst children)
* Torture and mutilation (e.g., Kasimir's severed ears)
* Mind control (e.g., Strahd's ***charm*** ability)
* (Implied) incest (e.g., the Belviews)
* (Implied) necrophilia (e.g., Nikolai Wachter)
* Stalking and (symbolic) sexual assault (e.g., Strahd's obsession with Ireena)
* Suicide (e.g., Tatyana's death)
* Drug addiction (e.g., the dream pastries)
* Body horror (e.g., the vestiges' dark gifts)
* Racism (e.g., Barovian views of the Vistani)
# Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia
## Lore of Barovia
### Metaphysics & Magic
The land of Barovia is a "demiplane"—a small, self-contained plane of existence. It is one of many Domains of Dread, which together occupy a small corner of the Shadowfell. 

Like all of the Domains of Dread, Barovia is entrapped by the mists of Ravenloft, as described in <span class="citation">Mists of Ravenloft (p. 23)</span>, and ruled by the mysterious Dark Powers. The Dark Powers are nameless, shapeless entities that serve as the jailers of the "Darklords" of the Domains: evil individuals who have committed unspeakable crimes. Strahd von Zarovich is one such Darklord.

Precious few—including only archmages, scholars, and (at times) the Darklords themselves—know that the Dark Powers exist. Fewer still know of their true nature and origins. While the Dark Powers were born from the miasma of evil that dwells within the Amber Temple of Barovia, they are not themselves the vestiges—the non-sapient fragments of dead, malevolent gods—that are sealed within the sarcophagi of the temple. (For more information about the vestiges of the Amber Temple, see <span class="citation">The Amber Temple (p. 181)</span>.)

The Dark Powers do not necessarily seek to corrupt those they encounter. Instead, for certain individuals, they seek to offer a choice between darkness and light—and to punish and ensnare those who fall to their temptations. In this adventure, two such individuals are Strahd von Zarovich and Ireena Kolyana.

As described in <span class="citation">Mists of Ravenloft</span> and <span class="citation">Sunlight in Barovia (p. 23-24)</span>, the land of Barovia is surrounded by a deadly fog that engulfs any creature that tries to leave, and has not known the light of the sun in centuries. 

Spells cast in Barovia function as described in <span class="citation">Alterations to Magic</span> and <span class="citation">Resurrection Madness (p. 24)</span>, and may be cosmetically modified in gruesome ways as described in <span class="citation">Cosmetic Spell Modifications (p. 24)</span>. While deities and patrons can still empower clerics and warlocks who make their way to Barovia, their ability to intervene directly—given the limited omnipotence of the Dark Powers within the Domains of Dread—is sorely limited.
### Geography
The geography of Barovia is largely as described in <span class="citation">Lay of the Land (p. 23)</span> and <span class="citation">Areas of Barovia (p. 33)</span>. However, the winding slopes of Tsolenka Pass now house the hidden village of **Soldav**, an isolated settlement of Mountain Folk who reject the druids' decision to worship Strahd as a deity.
### Cultures
#### Barovians
The denizens of the Village of Barovia are a broken, haunted people, largely as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 3: The Village of Barovia (p. 41)</span> and <span class="citation">Barovian Villagers (p. 41)</span>. 

Until recently, however, the village of Barovia faced few overt troubles. While not thriving, its residents eked out a meager existence and lived as well as they could.

That changed when the priest’s son, Doru—emboldened by the arrival of the vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten—incited a Barovian mob to march against Castle Ravenloft. Awoken from his long slumber, Strahd laid waste to the members of the mob, killing many of the village’s beloved sons and daughters. 

Strahd then roused an undead army and sent it against the village as punishment for their insolence. The siege of Barovia decimated the village, killing dozens and wounding many more. Only when Barovia’s burgomaster, a man named Kolyan Indirovich, was slain in battle, did Strahd’s forces ultimately withdraw, judging the slaughter to be sufficient discipline. 

The burgomaster’s children, Ismark and Ireena, took charge of the rebuilding effort. Even so, many Barovians, fearful of Strahd’s emergence and the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, left their ruined homes and broken families and fled for Vallaki to the west, hoping that its high walls could bring security. Many of those who remained in the village turned on Ismark, blaming him and his father for allowing Strahd to awaken, and for failing to do more to prevent Strahd’s counter strike. Ismark—named for “Ismark the Great,” an ancestral hero who rooted out nests of vampires across the valley—is now scorned as “Ismark the Lesser.”

The village has fallen into a state of paranoia, hopelessness, and despair. Neighbors mistrust neighbors, fearful that any person could be charmed by a vampire—or, worse, a vampire in disguise. Few go out of doors, whether day or night. All avoid the church, a scarred and haunted building rumored to be cursed by the Devil Strahd himself.
#### Vallakians
The people of Vallaki are largely as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 5: The Town of Vallaki (p. 95)</span> and <span class="citation">Townsfolk (p. 96)</span>. Though the town is ruled by Baron Vargas Vallakovich, the local burgomaster, few townsfolk view him with much love or respect. 

However, Baron Vallakovich commands the loyalty of Izek Strazni, a cruel and capricious brute who enforces the Baron’s will with an iron fist. Izek, as Captain of the Guard, commands the loyalty—and, more importantly, the salaries—of the town’s twenty-four guards, as described in <span class="citation">Town Gates (p. 95)</span>.

Though Vallaki is far from a police state, Izek has spies throughout the town—individuals that he has threatened or intimidated into keeping him abreast of news and information. Those who speak ill of the Baron or his “festivals” (described in <span class="citation">Chapter 5: The Town of Vallaki (p. 95)</span>) are thrown in the stocks as described in <span class="citation">Donkey-Headed Criminals (p. 119)</span>. Those who go further may find themselves forcibly summoned to the Baron’s manor for “corrective rehabilitation,” or even left to the tender mercies of Izek himself, whose diabolic mastery of fire allows him to burn his victims’ flesh or set their homes aflame.

As a result, the vast majority of Vallakians have surrendered themselves to Baron Vallakovich’s rule, too terrified of Izek to dare speak out. The sole exceptions are Lady Fiona Wachter, as described in <span class="citation">Vallaki Lore (p. 96)</span>, and the secret members of her devil-worshipping cult, as described in <span class="citation">Cultists (p. 96)</span> and <span class="citation">N4. Wachterhaus (p. 110)</span>.
#### Krezkians
The people of Krezk are largely as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 8: The Village of Krezk (p. 143)</span>, <span class="citation">S3. Village of Krezk (p. 145)</span>, and <span class="citation">Krezk Lore (p. 146)</span>. The villagers are largely unaware that their burgomaster, Dmitri Krezkov, is secretly a werewolf.
#### Vistani
The Vistani are largely as described in <span class="citation">Vistani (p. 26)</span>, with two major semi-permanent settlements: the encampment at Tser Pool (as described in <span class="citation">G. Tser Pool Encampment (p. 36)</span>), and the encampment near Vallaki (as described in <span class="citation">N9. Vistani Camp (p. 119)</span>). 

However, most Barovian Vistani view the valley as a temporary shelter from the evils of the world beyond, or as a brief stopover on their journeys through the mists. Only a few Vistani within Barovia reside there permanently and regard Strahd as their "king"; among those that do, even fewer serve Strahd faithfully as his eyes, ears, and hands amidst the valley. Most Barovian Vistani simply want to live their lives, to partake in life's wonders, and to raise their families in peace.
#### Dusk Elves
The dusk elves are as described in <span class="citation">Roleplaying the Vistani and the Elves (p. 119)</span>.
#### First Folk
The First Folk are a loose society of druidic hunter-gatherers descended from the nomads who first settled in the valley millenia ago. Since Strahd’s arrival in the valley, they have split into two factions: the Forest Folk, who worship Strahd as a deity and do his bidding across the Svalich Woods; and the Mountain Folk, a reclusive people who keep to the old religion of the Ladies Three and who largely remain within the sheltered settlement of Soldav, tucked away on the slopes of Mount Ghakis.
### Factions
#### Dark Powers

Both everywhere and nowhere, the Dark Powers are not quite a proper faction—their goals are inscrutable, their true agenda concealed. As the nameless jailers of Strahd von Zarovich, they seek only to ensure that his prison remains in place, and his suffering continues.

As part of Strahd’s punishment, however, the Dark Powers quietly work to keep the soul of Tatyana Federovna—now reincarnated as Ireena Kolyana—out of the vampire’s reach. For all their might, it is against the nature of the Dark Powers to act directly upon the souls within their domains: they can neither destroy her, nor command her spirit. 

However, as they once did with Strahd, the Dark Powers can always offer a choice—in Ireena’s case, a choice to end her existence, to flee from Strahd’s pursuit, and to find the safety of temporary oblivion. Nearly five hundred years ago, Tatyana Federovna accepted this offer, and leapt from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to her doom. Two centuries later, Marina Ulrich did the same, and let slip to her father the secret of Strahd’s pursuit.

Time and time again, the women bearing Tatyana’s soul have been offered this choice and, bereft of other options, made the decision to accept it. It is not yet Ireena’s time—but the Dark Powers are patient, and they know that, alone, she will inevitably fall once more into their grasp.

#### Keepers of the Feather

The Keepers of the Feather are largely as described in <span class="citation">Keepers of the Feather (p. 98)</span>, <span class="citation">The Martikov Family (p. 174)</span>, and <span class="citation">U6. Standing Stones (p. 165)</span>. The high-ranking membership is dominated by the Martikov family, with patriarch Davian Martikov directing the order’s activities. However, more than a dozen other members are also scattered incognito throughout Barovia, with most stationed in and around the town of Vallaki.

The Keepers, despite their lycanthropic nature, are spies—not warriors. With the sole exception of Muriel Vinshaw, a young **wereraven** with a fiery temper and a streak of defiance, the Keepers are reluctant to take up arms in battle. Few are trained in martial combat, and fewer still have the stomach for violence or blood. 

More importantly, one of the Keepers—a young **wereraven** named Elric, Muriel’s former romantic partner—recently accompanied Doru’s mob of Barovians to Castle Ravenloft, and was killed in the slaughter. Fearing Strahd’s attention, the rest of the Keepers are now laying low, hoping to keep their members safe and their secrets out of the vampire’s hands.

That doesn’t mean, though, that the Keepers are staying idle. Their spy network—led by Urwin Martikov and his wereraven associates—has tendrils that reach throughout the valley and mountains, gathering constant intelligence from the flocks of ravens that soar through the skies. Some among the Keepers joke that not a twig could be snapped in the Svalich Woods without Urwin knowing of it—and, sometimes, they wouldn’t be far wrong.

#### Barovian Refugees

Those Barovians who fled their village in the aftermath of Strahd’s siege faced a long and difficult path on the road to Vallaki. Several lost their lives, whether to wolf attacks or malicious undead, leaving the survivors to bury them along the way—if, of course, there was anything left to bury.

When they arrived outside Vallaki’s walls and asked for sanctuary, however, they were met with disturbing news: the gates of the town were closed to them. News of Barovia’s siege had traveled to Vallaki’s streets, and Baron Vallakovich had evidently become convinced that the Barovians themselves were an accursed, unsavory people—and that permitting them to enter his “perfect” town would only empower the Devil to destroy it.

Most of the refugees despaired, but only a few struck out on the path back to Barovia; those that did were never seen again. The rest linger on the outskirts of Vallaki, huddling in threadbare tents and bedrolls. Their encampment hugs close to Vallaki’s palisade walls, praying that the silvered spears and crossbows of the town’s guards will keep the beasts of the woods at bay—and that, sooner or later, the people of Vallaki will change their minds and allow them entry. 

So far, the wolves have kept their distance, but so have the Vallakians. With resources running low, and morale even lower, the refugees are slowly running out of time—even as the shadows of the woods creep ever-closer to their campfires.

#### Forest Folk

The Forest Folk are one of two groups descended from the hunter-gatherer nomads who first settled the valley. 

Nearly five centuries ago, when Strahd first invaded Barovia, a group of druidic elders approached him in secret with an offer. Fearful of repeating the oppression their people had once suffered under King Dostron, the elders told Strahd that they would guide him to the sacred places of the valley—the Fanes of the Ladies Three—and teach him the secrets of unlocking their power. In exchange, the elders asked for Strahd’s protection, and his promise that he would leave them in peace in a valley now flooded with blood and ghosts.

Strahd agreed, and, with the aid of the druidic elders, the archmage Khazan, and arcane research taken from the Amber Temple, fashioned a profane ritual with which to claim the Fanes for his own. In desecrating these holy sites, Strahd forged an unholy connection with the leylines that lay beneath them—and so became, in a way, the land of Barovia itself.

The elders’ betrayal split the First People, causing a schism that sent dark tremors through their weakened society. Some among them—in particular, the other druids, and the caste of primal berserkers who served them—grimly agreed with the elders’ choice. The Ladies of the Fanes, they reasoned, had long since abandoned the People. The days of tooth and claw had ended; the age of steel had begun. Seeking Strahd’s protection, they believed, was the only choice left to them.

The passage of time, however, has not been kind to the elders' legacy. Set adrift from their traditions and corrupted by darkness, the modern Forest Folk are a maddened, obsessed people, wholly dedicated to Strahd as their "god." Their leader is Svarog, a mad druid who has bonded his flesh to the Gulthias Tree that grows atop Yester Hill. The Forest Folk are now otherwise largely as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 14: Yester Hill (p. 197)</span> and <span class="citation">Hidden Graves (p. 198)</span>.

Recently, the Forest Folk were approached by Ludmilla Vilisevic, one of Strahd’s brides and an envoy from Baba Lysaga, the Witch of Berez. Ludmilla carried information indicating that the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens that opposed Strahd’s rule, used the nearby Wizard of Wines Winery as one of their hideouts. With Ludmilla’s aid, the druids of the Forest Folk fashioned a way to create and command blights—the children of the Gulthias Tree—and declared war upon the winery and all its inhabitants.

#### Mountain Folk

When the schism of the First People began, many were horrified at Strahd’s desecration of their holy places. In seeking protection from the evils of the world, they believed, the druidic elders had destroyed the very things that their society held dear. “Faithless,” they called the Forest Folk, and named Strahd “Shadowsworn” for the darkness he wielded. Unable to resist the druids’ power, or the might of Strahd’s armies, however, these rebels found themselves outmatched: powerless and alone in a world that no longer had a place for them.

Those who denied Strahd’s rule—largely hunters, artisans, and warriors—were cast out from the druids’ circles and fled for the slopes of the Balinok Mountains. There, they founded the hidden settlement of Soldav among the crags of Mount Ghakis. Banished from the woodlands of Barovia, they became the Mountain Folk, and set out to carve a new existence among the peaks.

Their spiritual leader, an elder **storm giant** named Burebis, is the sole mortal being that still remembers the old days: when the First People ruled the valley, and the Ladies of the Fanes showed them peace and prosperity. In his old age, however, Burebis’ weakened body has been swallowed up by the roots of Mount Ghakis, the embers of his spirit slowly dwindling as he awaits a sign of the *Rozana*’s return. For now, it is all he can do to keep Soldav hidden from Strahd and his spies, encircling the settlement with a constant cover of clouds and snow.

#### Beasts of Barovia

While not members of any civilized society, the wolves, rats, and bats of Barovia are Strahd’s loyal servants and spies. Each day, at sunrise and sunset, each beast with news to report—of outsiders, of turmoil, or simply of interesting trinkets or treasures—returns to Castle Ravenloft to share what it's learned and to receive new orders to disseminate through the valley. Strahd’s vampiric brides gather and organize their intelligence: the wolves to Volenta Popofsky, the rats to Ludmilla Vilisevic, and the bats to Anastrasya Karelova.


#### Brides of Strahd

Strahd’s eldest three vampiric consorts—Ludmilla, Anastrasya, and Volenta—serve their master loyally, but compete bitterly for his favor. As the eldest and most adept at the arcane arts, Ludmilla is Strahd’s favored research partner, developing new spells for his use while investigating the secrets of the Mists. Meanwhile, Anastrasya is a master of the arts of espionage and diplomacy, managing Strahd’s political relationships while retaining key spies in each of Barovia’s settlements. Finally, Volenta is a skilled artificer and torturer, innovating new traps to guard Ravenloft’s halls while wringing information from those who fall into them.

Over the past hundred years, with Strahd asleep in Castle Ravenloft, each of his brides dispersed through the valley to pursue their own agendas. Now, with Strahd awoken, and his moment of reckoning at hand, each bride is desperate to prove their loyalty and worth to Strahd once more—and to win their place at his side when his grand plan comes to fruition.

#### Witches of Mother Night

While the good-hearted worshippers of Barovia keep the faith of the Morninglord alive, other, darker individuals seek the power and favor of Mother Night instead. Chief among them is Baba Lysaga, the Witch of Berez, who has fostered a coven of fellow devotees by recruiting outcasts and exiles from the settlements of Barovia. The maddened Lysaga views these practitioners as her children, and teaches them to secretly consider themselves the younger siblings of Strahd—sworn to protect and obey him for eternity.

These witches are largely as described in <span class="citation">Barovian Witch (p. 229)</span>, though their pacts are forged with Mother Night instead of Strahd and the Dark Powers. Those sent to Ravenloft serve at the pleasure of Ludmilla Vilisevic, Strahd’s magic-minded consort, though none forget that their true loyalty is owed to Baba Lysaga of the swamp—and, above her, to Strahd himself.

#### Wachtercult

As part of her latest scheme to gain control of Vallaki, Lady Fiona Wachter has founded a devil-worshipping cult, described further in <span class="citation">N4. Wachterhaus (p. 110)</span>. Currently, Lady Wachter’s “book club” boasts six cult fanatics, with each fanatic leading a smaller cell of six cultists as described in <span class="citation">Cultists (p. 96)</span>. 

#### Werewolf Pack

The werewolf pack—the members of whom call themselves the Children of Mother Night—are largely as described in **Chapter 15: Werewolf Den (p. 201). Until Strahd’s awakening, the pack largely used Barovia as a place to rest between hunts, occasionally prowling the roads between settlements, but preferring the tastier meat of the lands beyond the mists.

However, when Strahd awoke, he demanded the loyalty of the werewolves whose forebears had once served him faithfully. He threatened to seal the pack within the mists for all eternity if they defied him—but promised them wealth, power, and plentiful prey if they returned to his service.

\pagebreakNum

Emil, the leader of the pack, resisted Strahd’s efforts to strip the pack of its agency. He quietly argued that the Children of Mother Night had always been free—free to hunt and kill and live as they chose—and suggested that the pack pretend to accept Strahd’s terms, but abandon Barovia as soon as the mists reopened to them.

But Emil was betrayed. Kiril, a young and haughty werewolf who felt his strength had gone unrecognized, was lured by Strahd’s promises of riches and might. Kiril reported Emil’s plot to Strahd’s own ear—and, when the vampire’s dire wolves dragged Emil to the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, was rewarded with the leadership of the werewolf pack.

Now, as the pack’s new alpha and Strahd’s faithful servant, Kiril leads his werewolves on a savage and bloody crusade to dominate the wild places of Barovia, though he dreams of one day surmounting the settlements’ walls and devouring their people like sheep. Meanwhile, Emil’s mate Zuleika, the pack’s holy woman and soothsayer, sits alone in Mother Night’s shrine, silently praying for deliverance—or vengeance.

#### Amber Vestiges

The vestiges of the Amber Temple are not sentient as most would imagine it; as the decaying remnants of dead gods, they are mere scraps of malevolent power, described further in <span class="citation">Chapter 13: The Amber Temple (p. 181)</span>, <span class="citation">Amber Sarcophagi (p. 191)</span>, and <span class="citation">X33. Amber Vaults (p. 191)</span>.

Even so, that is not dead which can eternal lie. From the chill of their amber tombs, these vestiges dream of the power they once wielded—and of a path to renewed apotheosis. Shards of their amber sarcophagi are scattered across the land of Barovia, with each shard bearing a psychic connection to the vestige it once imprisoned. Through these shards, the vestiges can whisper words of corruption, promising power without price. This is a lie: no power is without cost, and the shreds of darkness the vestiges offer warp and transform their recipients—in subtle ways at first, but swelling grotesquely over time.

Elisabeth Durst of Death House once bore one of these amber shards; Izek Strazni of Vallaki holds one today. These shards are merely a gateway, however—through small tastes of power, the vestiges hope to lure their victims to the Amber Temple itself. There, the vestiges can offer their greatest dark gifts—and, in doing so, claim their true price and prize: a sliver of the victim’s soul.

With each scrap of spirit a vestige claims, it grows in power, inching closer to the day that it will have the strength to break free of its amber prison. One has already succeeded. Others are now on the precipice. And for those that remain—eternity is full of possibilities, and the dead have nothing but time.

#### The Ladies of the Fanes

With their holy places desecrated and their worshippers weakened and divided, two of the three Ladies of the Fanes—the Weaver and the Huntress—have been reduced to little more than spirit, unable to take action or exercise the power they once wielded. Only the Seeker, who forged a pact with Katarina, the bastard sister of Strahd von Zarovich, to free the valley from Strahd’s evil, survives. Through their pact, the Seeker subsumed Katarina’s soul to manifest an avatar of her divine power: the Vistana seer Madam Eva.


As an aspect of the Seeker, Madam Eva is bound to follow the rules of her divinity. She cannot refuse to read another’s fortune, nor can she share her foretellings with any but those who hear them. Many individuals, both savory and not, have therefore called upon her to see their futures—including, at times, Strahd von Zarovich himself.

Given Madam Eva’s exceptionally long lifespan—far longer than any ordinary human—Strahd strongly suspects that she is more than she appears. However, thus far, Madam Eva has been content to give him the foretellings he seeks—and he, in response, has been content to accept her sly smiles and denials.

However, Madam Eva foresees that Strahd will soon return to her for a final, terrible time—and that the reading she will deliver shall define the fate of all Barovia.
### Religions

#### The Church of the Morninglord
The dominant faith in Barovia worships the deity known as the Morninglord, a god of dawn and renewal. In centuries past, with the sun always hidden behind overcast skies, the people’s faith had slowly slipped into empty ritual. 

With Strahd newly awoken, however, a wave of despair has swept across the valley—and, with it, a streak of religious revivalism. Vallaki in particular has seen a dramatic expansion in worshippers seeking hope, comfort, and a sense of security from the faith of their forefathers. Father Lucian Petrovich, the priest of St. Andral’s Church in Vallaki, does what he can to preach the Morningword’s grace, as described in **N1. St. Andral’s Church (p. 97), but even he has his quiet doubts about how far that protection can go.

> [!lore]+ **The Names of the Gods**
>
> In *Forgotten Realms* lore, "Morninglord" is the epithet of Lathander, the greater god of dawn and renewal. However, no canonical deity has the epithet "Mother Night," leaving her true name a mystery.
>
> Mother Night's identity is, admittedly, irrelevant to the narrative of this campaign. However, her divine portfolio—including witches, foresight, nocturnal beasts, and lycanthropes—most closely matches that of Shar, the *Forgotten Realms*' greater god of trickery and death. Known also as the "Mistress of the Night," Shar was the creator of the Shadowfell, the realm in which Barovia—and all the Demiplanes of Dread—now reside.

#### The Coven of Mother Night
Though most Barovians worship the Morninglord in public, a precious few scorn his faith and instead turn their worship to Mother Night, seeking safety, power, or simple vengeance. Witches and werewolves comprise the bulk of Mother Night’s followers, though some ordinary Barovians build secret shrines to her, joining in profane fellowship with the creatures of night.
#### The Cult of Ezra
Some Barovians are neither wholly satisfied with the faith of the Morninglord nor depraved enough to seek the blessings of Mother Night. In their eyes, the Morninglord is a powerless or craven deity, unable to save his own worshippers or even raise a single sunrise, while Mother Night is a cruel and savage being, too dangerous to acknowledge or worship.

These Barovians walk a middle path, and instead worship Ezra, the Mistwalker: the god of the Mists, or—as some suggest—the embodiment of the Mists themselves. (See <span class="citation">Ezra, God of the Mists, Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft at p. 64</span>, for more information.) 

In Barovia, the followers of Ezra preach that power is an illusion, and suffering life’s only constant. Many believe that tales of the sun are myths, and that Barovia has neither past nor future: only an unceasing present that must be forever endured.

Though she preaches devil-worship to her cult, Lady Fiona Wachter of Vallaki is a quiet worshipper of Ezra. Many turn to Ezra for comfort in times of tragedy, finding it easier to believe that hope is an illusion than to believe that it may be attained and then lost. 

Few, however, suspect the horrible truth: that “Ezra” does not, and has never existed—and that her soothing voice is merely a simulacrum conjured by the twisted whispers of the Dark Powers themselves.
#### The Faith of the Ladies Three
In Soldav, the hidden bastion of the Mountain Folk, the people still keep to the old faith of the Ladies of the Fanes: the Weaver, the Seeker, and the Huntress. They do their best to honor their goddesses with offerings of food, flowers, and song, but mourn the loss of knowledge and tradition that came when the druids betrayed their faith for Strahd’s protection. They no longer remember the sacred rites that once bound their ancestors to the Ladies’ fellowship, nor do they remember the secrets of the Ladies’ blessings.

The Mountain Folk still remember, though, that the Weaver’s holy place was the Swamp Fane, near the ruined town on the shores of the Luna River; the Huntress's, the Forest Fane, atop Yester Hill; and the Seeker’s, the Mountain Fane, in a western clearing in the valley's woodland basin.

They remember that the Seeker was a goddess of foresight, prophecy, and storms, her sigil a raven’s eye, ever-searching. They remember that the Weaver was a goddess of resilience, craftsmanship, and care, her sigil a spider’s delicate web. They remember, too, that the Huntress was a goddess of beasts, wild places, and war, her sigil a sharpened wolf’s tooth.

Together, this trinity oversaw each life that was born in the valley: the Seeker, forging the threads of fate that would bind them together; the Weaver, spinning those threads into a lush and vibrant tapestry; and the Huntress, cutting each thread at its appointed time, and ushering its soul into death.
## History of Barovia
### The Ancient Era (3,000 BU–0 BC)
#### Origins of the Valley
Nearly four millenia ago, the land of Barovia was a peaceful valley inhabited by the First Folk: a nomadic society of hunter-gatherers. When they arrived in the valley—which they called "Cerunnos," meaning "fertile land"—the First Folk brought with them the worship of a trio of minor fey goddesses that they called the *Rozana*. 

To honor them, the First Folk built three sacred fanes at places of natural power—the Swamp Fane, the Forest Fane, and the Mountain Fane. These fanes served as conduits for the goddess' power, allowing the *Rozana*—known informally as the Ladies Three, or simply the Ladies—to walk among their worshippers and to anchor themselves to the land they loved.

The Ladies Three wielded powerful magic, bringing good fortune to those that followed their ways. Only their most devout priests knew the Ladies’ names; to all others, they were known as the Weaver, the Huntress, and the Seeker.

For as long as they ruled the land, the Ladies acted as its sovereigns, making their will known through auguries and omens. Through intermediaries, they wielded powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They drew power from water, air, and earth, and were bound to the ancient valley in which they dwelled. It was said that the Ladies could hear everything that happened in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses. 

Two of the Ladies bestowed upon their most faithful worshippers the gifts of lycanthropy: flocks of wereravens served the Seeker’s will, while packs of Good-aligned werewolves called wolfir raced through the woods to join the Huntress’s Wild Hunt. Meanwhile, the Weaver fashioned three gemstones the size and shape of pinecones, imbued them with the raw energies of life, and delivered them to her priests with a promise that the bounties of the woods would always feed them and their children.
#### The Amber Temple
Though the First Folk were the first to claim the valley, they were far from the last. Two thousand years after the First Folk passed through the Balinok Mountains, a secret society of wizards worshipping a nameless god of secrets came into the valley. These wizards founded the Amber Temple near the peak of Mount Ghakis, as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 13: The Amber Temple (p. 181)</span>, and used it to contain the vestiges of dead, hateful gods, which they imprisoned in amber sarcophagi in the temple’s deepest vaults.

When the forces of evil sought to claim the vestiges’ power for their own, the wizards resolved to guard the Temple themselves, and built a road from the Temple through the mountains to import supplies. To protect it, they constructed the defenses described in <span class="citation">T1. Gatehouse Portcullis</span>, <span class="citation">T2. Demon Statues</span>, and <span class="citation">T3. Curtain of Green Flame (p. 157)</span> along the winding Tsolenka Pass. 

However, these defenses could not stop the wizards themselves from falling to the vestiges’ corruption. Within three generations, nearly all of the wizards were dead as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 13: The Amber Temple (p. 181)</span>. The lone survivor—an archmage named Neferon—was transfigured to an immortal, monstrous form and settled in to guard his “hoard.”
#### Fall of the First Folk
The seven tribes of the First Folk kept largely apart from one another until, one day, a proud and ambitious warlord named Kavan led his tribe down the slopes of the Balinok Mountains, waging a bloody war to unite them. His magic spear, the symbol of his might, drank the blood from his enemies and fed their strength to its wielder; for this, Kavan was called Blood-Drinker, and his spear *bloodthorn*.

Kavan’s conquest united the tribes, but broke their sacred peace. The Ladies’ words grew mournful and quiet on the wind, even as their priests—the druids who enacted their sacred rituals—found themselves subject to the whims and scorn of Kavan’s warrior caste. The wolfir fled into the woods, and the wereravens to the mountains. Fearful of the corruption that Kavan might wreak upon them, the Weaver’s eldest druids bestowed her life-giving gems to the wereravens for safekeeping, ensuring that the secrets of their power would die with them.

When Kavan passed and was buried with his spear at Yester Hill, a new chieftain fought to take his place, beginning a line of brutal successions that lasted for centuries. Where the wizards of the Amber Temple had been content to keep to themselves, however, the First Folk could not remain isolated forever. 

Four centuries after Kavan’s death, King Dostron, a cruel and ambitious monarch described further in <span class="citation">Crypt 34: King Dostron the Hellborn (p. 92)</span>, sought to claim Barovia’s splendor for his own nearby kingdom. He invaded the valley, massacred its inhabitants, and desecrated their holy places with wanton abandon.

Dostron's invasion shattered the Ladies' power, driving their surviving followers back into the slopes of the Balinok Mountains. To cement his claim to the valley, Dostron bade his troops to builld an enormous stone fortress atop a mountain to the east and settled there to taste the land’s many riches. 

However, King Dostron’s hand reached too far, leaving his kingdom rocked by calamity and war. When he died, thirty years after he had first invaded the valley, his generals buried him in the crypts beneath his fortress and left it behind to fall into ruin.

Even so, the damage to the First Folk had been done. Never again would they reach their former glory; never again would their priests work the Ladies’ greatest miracles. Though the land was still beloved of the *Rozana*, a crack had been left in its heart—a crack that, centuries later, Strahd von Zarovich would exploit.

Meanwhile, near the peak of Mount Ghakis, the evil archmage Exethanter breached the wards of the Amber Temple, as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 13: The Amber Temple (p. 181)</span>. After becoming a lich, Exethanter seized control of the temple from Neferon, transforming the long-dead wizards into **flameskulls** under his command and settling in to welcome fellow seekers to the corridors of power.
### The Founding Era (1 BC–345 BC)
#### The Von Zarovich Line
More than four centuries after King Dostron's death, King Barov von Zarovich I became the first monarch of his House, unifying several separate city states to found the nation of Zarovia. The young kingdom thrived for two hundred years, until civil strife and foreign invaders caused it to fracture and drove House von Zarovich into exile.

However, the dream of Zarovia never left King Barov’s descendants. One hundred years after their exile, Barov von Zarovich II, the heir to the family name, took up arms to reclaim his namesake’s legacy. Wielding his cunning and wealth, Barov II built an army of soldiers legions strong and began to carve out a territory that he could be proud to call his kingdom. 

Barov’s crusade was buoyed when Saint Andral—a spiritual leader among the Church of the Morninglord, despairing at the chaos and poverty that had embroiled the kingdom since its fall—granted him the crown of old Zarovia. With Barov’s aid, Saint Andral became the Most High Priest of the Morninglord’s church; with Andral’s aid, Barov’s expansion became a holy war.

The kingdom of the dusk elves—a former province of Zarovia—declined to pay fealty to King Barov, who declared war. Within a year, Barov’s forces—aided by Rahadin, the exiled dusk elf son of Prince Erevan Löwenhart, described further in <span class="citation">Rahadin (p. 237)</span>—had conquered the dusk elves, obliterating the elven royal line and subjugating those that remained.

With the aid of Ciril Romulich, King Barov took the hilt of Prince Löwenhart's shattered *moonblade* and used it to forge the *Brightblade*: a crystal blade of radiant light. To further empower the sword, the witch Baba Lysaga—King Barov's advisor on matters of magic—sealed Prince Löwenhart's spirit within the blade.

Not longer thereafter, however, Baba Lysaga was banished for her unhealthy attachment to the king's newborn son, Strahd, as described in <span class="citation">Baba Lysaga (p. 228)</span>. Seven years later, the young Strahd, joined his father’s army as a squire. While at war, Barov also sired a bastard daughter, Katarina, by a Vistani woman. (See <span class="citation">Madam Eva (p. 233)</span>.)

A decade after the fall of the dusk elves, Strahd—now a soldier and captain under King Barov’s command—was wounded in battle and rescued by the Vistani, as described in <span class="citation">The Dancing Fire (p. 20)</span>. 

Within four years of his safe return, Strahd became a general in King Barov’s army, leading the vanguard of the conquering force. As he waged war upon his family’s enemies, Strahd saw neither leaf nor stone of his family’s homeland, more often sleeping in tents on soggy, bloodstained earth than in royal sheets and linens.

Within five years of Strahd’s dispatch to the front lines—by the time Strahd himself was twenty-six years old—his mother, Queen Ravenovia, bore Barov a second son: Sergei.
#### Arrival of the Outsiders
Less than a decade after Sergei’s birth, a world away in the valley of the First Folk, Saint Markovia, a priest of the Morninglord, began the construction of an abbey on a spur of Mount Baratok. Markovia, a fierce opponent of Saint Andral’s support for Barov’s claim, sought to create a sanctuary of reflection and peace far away from the killing fields. Priests and refugees alike heeded her call, and within two years, the Abbey of Saint Markovia was complete. 

To sanctify it, Markovia blessed a sacred pool at the base of the mountain below, as described in <span class="citation">S4. Pool and Shrine (p. 146)</span>. A trading post was established nearby—which, over time, grew into a small and humble hamlet.

Within three years of the Abbey’s founding, a renewed interest in the region’s history drew Argynvost, a silver dragon, to uncover the lost secrets of the Amber Temple, as described in <span class="citation">Ch. 7: Argynvostholt (p. 129)</span>. Given the unrest and bloodshed that dominated the lands nearby, Argynvost feared that evildoers might seek out the Temple and unleash the darkness that slumbered within. 

The dragon moved quickly to develop plans for the Order of the Silver Dragon: an order of valiant knights that would do battle to defend the innocent. Their true, hidden purpose, however, would be to guard the Temple from evil and ensure that its prisoners remained secured.

After relocating to the valley, Argynvost began the construction of the manor of Argynvostholt, his new lair and the headquarters for the Order of the Silver Dragon. 

He dedicated its chapel to the Morninglord, and—as a shrewd political gesture—its upstairs gallery to both Saint Andral *and* Saint Markovia, who by now had become the two competing spiritual leaders of the Morninglord’s faith. 

With the mansion complete, Argynvost put out the call for knights to join his order—and, as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 7: Argynvostholt (p. 129)</span> and <span class="citation">Q40. Argynvost's Study (p. 140)</span>, they came. 

Many were dispatched to the front lines of nearby conflicts to wage war against evil—including, in some places, the armies of King Barov von Zarovich II, who had begun to test the borders of long-peaceful nations with an ambitious and obvious hunger.

With the Abbey and manor drawing new settlers to the valley, the descendants of the wereravens that had once fled Kavan’s tyranny now saw an opportunity to thrive. Using the last of the secrets passed down from their ancestors, they reshaped the Weaver’s lifegiving gemstones to grow strong, hearty grapes in the woodlands’ rich soil. They built a winery along the western edge of the valley, and—hoping to conceal the true source of their produce—named it the “Wizard of Wines,” spreading a rumor that a powerful mage had founded the business.

The winery soon forged strong relationships with Argynvost and Markovia, and a profitable trade began. Deliveries to the Abbey were stored in <span class="citation">S16. Wine Cellar (p. 152)</span>, while deliveries to Argynvostholt were kept in <span class="citation">Q11. Wine Storage (p. 133)</span>. News of the Wizard of Wines drew new immigrants to the valley, bolstering the Order’s forces and further growing the hamlet at the base of the abbey.

With the winery completed, however, Argynvost foresaw that an economic boom in the valley might bring about the very fears he had founded the Order of the Silver Dragon to prevent. To fortify the existing gatehouse at Tsolenka Pass, he directed his knights to construct a white stone tower overlooking the road, securing it from any who might seek to embark toward the Temple on foot.

Throughout this process, the First Folk watched cautiously, fearful of the newcomers’ sudden and aggressive expansion—but far more fearful that provocation could spur a reprisal to rival King Dostron’s greatest cruelties. And so, they remained amidst the woodlands and mountain slopes, silently observing the newcomers’ activities.
### The Era of Blood (346 BC–351 BC)
#### Birth of Barovia
King Barov did not live to see the fruits of his labors. When he passed into death, Strahd inherited his lands and enemies and vowed to finish what his father had started. Though he had been Barov’s heir, Strahd did not name himself king; instead, he deferred the ancient crown of Zarovia, keeping it in a chest carried by his attendants. A kingdom was not enough—Strahd dreamed of forging an empire.

Strahd refused, too, his father’s *Brightblade*, gifting it to Sergei—now a priest in the Morninglord’s church—on the grounds that his legacy was his own to win. His own blade had sufficed for the countless battles before; it would suffice for the wars to come.

War came first from the long-subjugated dusk elves, who—hoping to take advantage of the change in leadership—staged a rebellion against the governor that Strahd had set over their homeland. 

Emboldened by the elves’ courage, other nations entered the fray, staging troops near the kingdom’s borders and issuing embargoes and high tariffs on goods transported from its markets and ports.

Where his generals saw threats, however, Strahd saw opportunities. Such newfound hostilities provided him with the perfect justification to sow the seeds of his future empire. He began by mercilessly crushing the dusk elves’ rebellion, as described in <span class="citation">Kasimir Velikov (p. 232)</span>, and proceeded to declare war on every nation that had ever insulted or opposed him. The dusk elves were left to the care of the Vistani, who spirited them away to the valley in which Strahd’s enemies—the Order of the Silver Dragon and the Abbey of Saint Markovia—offered sanctuary and peace.

By now, Strahd’s forces were legion, their soldiers a ruthless fighting force that embodied his conquering ambition. Though technically outnumbered, Strahd’s cunning and military prowess allowed him to cut through any opposing force with ease—and, one by one, the dominoes fell.

Within six months of Strahd's ascension, his armies had waged a bloody military campaign that had reunited, and then *surpassed* the ancient borders of Old Zarovia—and yet Strahd’s hunger was unabated. With few others left, the Order of the Silver Dragon stepped forward to lead and coordinate the defensive alliance, winning several crucial battles that temporarily stopped Strahd’s advance in its tracks. (See <span class="citation">Chapter 7: Argynvostholt (p. 129)</span>.) 

Vladimir Horngaard, a young captain among the Order, proved instrumental in directing the war effort; for his courage and skill, Argynvost made him a field commander, as described in <span class="citation">Vladimir Horngaard (p. 241)</span>. By the first frost of winter, however, Vladimir believed that Strahd’s advance could no longer be stopped. He issued the order to retreat, escorting hundreds of refugees to Argynvostholt in the hopes that winter and the natural protection of the Balinok Mountains would keep them safe.

But Vladimir’s hopes proved in vain. Before the end of winter, Strahd’s forces tracked the Order to the valley—now the last bastion of resistance against his dreams of empire. 

When Strahd’s reinforcements arrived, they breached the valley’s natural defenses, and did battle with the Order’s knights—and the silver dragon Argynvost himself—on the marshy field beneath the fortress of Argynvostholt. In what would later be called the Battle of the Luna River, Commander Vladimir Horngaard, Vladimir's husband Sir Godfrey Gwilym, and nearly all of the knights of the Order were slaughtered. 

Despairing and enraged, Argynvost retreated to his lair: the manor of Argynvostholt itself. Strahd’s forces pursued him within, the resulting battle destroying the mansion’s western wing (described in <span class="citation">Q4. Spiders' Ballroom (p. 132)</span>, <span class="citation">Q32. Ruined Bedchambers (p. 138)</span>, and <span class="citation">Q48. Roof's Edge (p. 141)</span>) and bursting a hole in its roof (described in <span class="citation">Q43. Hole in Roof (p. 140)</span> and <span class="citation">Q33. Collapsed Ceiling (p. 138)</span>.). When silence finally fell, the dragon’s corpse lay unmoving upon the floor. 

Strahd’s soldiers looted the manor, as described in <span class="citation">Q23. Storage Room (p. 135)</span>, <span class="citation">Q37. Knights of the Order (p. 139)</span>, <span class="citation">Q39. Vladimir's Bedroom (p. 140)</span>, <span class="citation">Q40. Argynvost's Study (p. 140)</span>, and <span class="citation">Q41. Dragon's Vault (p. 140)</span>. Strahd then had Argynvost's corpse hacked to pieces and stripped to the bone, intending to keep the dragon's skull as a trophy.

When the dust of Strahd’s final battle had settled, he was finally left with no more foes to destroy—and no more lands to conquer. His advisors urged him to return to his homeland to govern, but Strahd had better ideas. He was envious of his mother’s attention to Sergei, eager to escape the shadow of his father’s legacy, and struck by the beauty of the valley he’d conquered. He named the valley “Barovia”—not after his father, but after King Barov I, the great patriarch of the Von Zarovich line—and decided to settle there.
#### Rise of Castle Ravenloft
Not all the denizens of the valley were grateful to see Strahd’s arrival. Saint Markovia, embittered by the death of her friend, Argynvost, visited Strahd’s court to condemn him as a mad tyrant. Magnanimous in victory, Strahd allowed her to depart in peace, amused by the futility of her convictions.

Meanwhile, after a lifetime spent at war, Strahd began to turn to the question of peace. As noted in <span class="citation">Barovians (p. 24)</span>, Strahd repopulated the valley with human subjects drawn from his other conquered lands. The nobleman Boris Vallakovich, described further in <span class="citation">Chapter 5: The Town of Vallaki (p. 95)</span> and <span class="citation">N8. Town Square (p. 119)</span>, founded the town of Vallaki in the heart of the valley, while the noblewoman Vasha Krezkova settled within the hamlet at the foot of the Abbey of Saint Markovia, naming it “Krezk.” 

For her family’s loyalty, Strahd bequeathed to the Krezkovs the Wizard of Wines winery, its former owners having fled amidst the tides of war. He awarded parcels of land to the noble House of Wachter, described in <span class="citation">N4q. Storage Room (p. 114)</span>, who settled in the growing town of Vallaki. Meanwhile, Elisabeth and Gustav Durst, the heirs to a wealthy merchant family, funded a grain mill near Vallaki—<span class="citation">Chapter 6: Old Bonegrinder (p. 125)</span>—atop a promontory overlooking the valley. The Dursts themselves settled in the newborn village of Barovia, a settlement that had spawned among Strahd’s military encampment to the east.

Saint Andral, now the Most High Priest of the Morninglord’s church, passed away at the ripe age of eighty-two. A church was built in Vallaki and named St. Andral’s Church in his honor, his bones interred in a crypt beneath the altar. Meanwhile, an old witch named Baba Lysaga—Strahd’s former nursemaid, as described in <span class="citation">Baba Lysaga (p. 228)</span>—followed Strahd’s forces to the valley, settling in a small, ramshackle hut amidst the Svalich Woods.

The dusk elves—the same refugees who had fled the aftermath of Strahd’s rebellion not long before—found themselves trapped in the heart of their conqueror’s new empire. After a lengthy debate led by their leader, Kasimir Velikov, the elves reluctantly agreed to remain in the new homes they had built in the valley, hoping that the sanctuary of the Vistani would keep them safe from further reprisal. 

Kasimir’s sister Patrina Velikovna, however, an archmage of considerable power, felt stirred to further action. With the Order of the Silver Dragon fallen, she investigated the secrets it had left behind—and so discovered the secret of the Amber Temple. There, she completed her studies of the black arts, and began to hatch a dark and ambitious plan.

With the repopulation of the valley well underway, Strahd now turned to his own home. He summoned artisans, wizards, and workers loyal to him, described in <span class="citation">Chapter 4: Castle Ravenloft (p. 49)</span> and <span class="citation">The Vampire's History (p. 9)</span>, and set them the task of constructing a castle worthy of his family’s legacy. He chose to place it atop the ruins of an ancient stone keep—the very same fortress built by King Dostron centuries before—and named it Castle Ravenloft, for his mother Queen Ravenovia.

However, Strahd did not suffer peace well. Restless, and feeling like his best years were behind him, he experimented with an assortment of eccentric hobbies and arts before finally turning to the study of magic. Mages flocked to his court for the chance to serve as his arcane tutor—and, seeing opportunity, Patrina did the same.

Near-ageless and fair, the elven Patrina knew well of humanity’s fear of death. Where others saw a powerful conqueror, Patrina saw a man of middling age fast-approaching his twilight years. She whispered in his ear the name of the Amber Temple—and the secret of immortality it concealed—and Strahd eagerly listened.

Upon Strahd’s arrival at the Amber Temple, the lich Exethanter welcomed him with open arms, as described <span class="citation">Chapter 13: The Amber Temple (p. 181)</span>. Patrina led him to an amber sarcophagus deep in the temple, to the vestige that offered the dark gift of Tenebrous: the secret of lichdom. She spoke to him of the grand power he could wield—of the ageless aeons through which he could conquer. 

What she left unspoken, of course, was that the vestige’s dark gift could be wielded only by an archmage capable of the highest circles of magic—a level that, with his fledgling skill, Strahd could reach only with her aid and influence.

Patrina was not surprised when Strahd insisted upon speaking with each of the three vestiges in the temple’s amber vault; he was a man of power, and men of power enjoyed the drugs of knowledge and control. She was astounded, however, when—after being offered the dark gifts of Tenebrous, of Zhudun, and the Vampyr—Strahd declined them all, refusing Patrina’s promise of immortality.

Strahd returned to Castle Ravenloft, mortal and unchanged. Troubled, yet fascinated, Patrina followed after him.

Strahd continued his studies of magic, learning at a far more rapid—and voracious—pace then any student Patrina had yet seen. Suspicious of his fellow dusk elf’s motives, however, Rahadin—now one of Strahd’s most trusted advisors—began to seek out women who could distract him from Patrina.

Meanwhile, the construction of Castle Ravenloft continued unabated. As a token of his favor, Strahd led one of the mages—a brilliant architect named Artimus—to the Amber Temple itself, showing him the secrets of setting magic deep into quarried stone. There, Artimus finalized the design of the castle itself, as described in <span class="citation">X20. Architect's Room (p. 187)</span>.

Just over a year after construction had begun, Castle Ravenloft was finished. Strahd appointed Rahadin as the chamberlain of the keep, as described in <span class="citation">Rahadin (p. 236)</span>. He then summoned his mother, Queen Ravenovia, and his brother, Sergei—now a high priest in the Church of the Morninglord—to join him in Barovia. With their work complete, Strahd’s masons and mages departed the castle; the archmage Khazan, however, chose to settle in the valley, constructing a magical tower in Lake Baratok as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 11: Van Richten's Tower (p. 167)</span>.

Afflicted with poor health—perhaps as a result of Baba Lysaga’s curse, as described in <span class="citation">Baba Lysaga (p. 228)</span>—Queen Ravenovia did not survive the journey to Barovia. Two months after she and Sergei had departed, he and her coffin arrived in the valley. It was in grief for their mother that Strahd met Sergei for the first time in each of their lives, and both oversaw the Queen’s burial in the newly-built crypts of Castle Ravenloft.

Sergei, however, did not arrive alone. He was accompanied by Ciril Romulich, a high priest of the Church of the Morninglord (described in <span class="citation">Crypt 30: Prefect Ciril Romulich (p. 91)</span>. Ciril provided Strahd with the *Icon of Ravenloft*, described in <span class="citation">K15. Chapel (p. 57)</span> and <span class="citation">Icon of Ravenloft (p. 222)</span>, to consecrate the castle and its chapel. 

Ciril also delivered news that the priest Kir—the Most High Priest of the Morninglord’s church and Saint Andral’s successor—had crafted a strange holy relic called the *Sigil of the Sun* that he claimed was needed to prepare for the coming of a future enemy.

Kir, however, had died in the process, leaving the position of Most High Priest vacant—a position that the council of high priests chose Sergei to fill. Sergei, already the bearer of King Barov’s *Brightblade*, was now also given the *Sigil of the Sun* as a symbol of his new station, and set about preparing to assume the role. 
#### Strahd Becomes the Land
With Castle Ravenloft’s furnishings now largely complete, Strahd installed the *pièce de résistance*: the skull of Argynvost, mounted upon the wall of his great war-room as a trophy. (See <span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span>.) However, this final desecration enraged the spirit of Commander Vladimir Horngaard, who returned to life as a revenant to avenge the destruction of the Order of the Silver Dragon. His zeal was so great that it also brought back the spirits of his fellow fallen knights, as described in <span class="citation">The Order of the Silver Dragon (p. 129)</span>.

It was then, as the revenants of the Order ravaged Strahd’s perfect valley, that a circle of druidic elders among the First Folk saw an opportunity. The new denizens of Barovia had begun to expand their settlements into the wild places of the land, pushing the First Folk back toward the Balinok Mountains. As tensions mounted and a series of small skirmishes unfolded, the elders feared that a return of King Dostron’s genocide was imminent.

Those elders secretly approached Strahd with an offer. He would provide the First Folk with his protection, defending their people and the integrity of their woodland home. In exchange, the elders would guide him to three hidden places of power within the valley—the sacred fanes of the Ladies Three—and teach him to command their might.

Amused by their audacity and intrigued by the possibilities, Strahd tentatively accepted the druids’ offer. He allowed them to guide him to the Mountain Fane first—the closest to Castle Ravenloft—and proceeded to study it and its properties in exhaustive detail. The elders shared with him the secrets of its ancient rituals, the blessings that it granted the Lady’s champions, and the bonds it shared with the earth of the valley itself.

With their aid, guided by the fell arcana that Patrina had taught him and a flash of his own genius, Strahd forged a profane ritual that would tie the Fane’s power to his own spirit. It was a clumsy attempt, admittedly—a bond that he would return to refine again and again in the centuries to come. But when the first drops of Strahd’s blood soaked into the Fane’s earth, he felt its power infuse his very soul. The land became a part of him—and he, a part of the land.

Strahd repeated the process at the valley’s two other sacred places: the Swamp Fane, just east of the young town of Berez; and the Forest Fane, south of the Wizard of Wines winery. With each site he claimed, he felt his bond to the land grow stronger. The beasts, woodlands, and even the very skies of the valley seemed to sing to him—and he followed that song to crush Vladimir Horngaard and his undead knights wherever their spirits fled.
#### Sergei and Tatyana
By the time Strahd returned once more to Castle Ravenloft, his spirits buoyed by the new turn in the war against the revenants, he found Sergei to be in high spirits. Sergei had fallen in love with a young woman named Tatyana Federovna, described in <span class="citation">The Vampire's History (p. 9)</span>, and visited her daily in the village of Barovia to pursue her affections. On a whim, Strahd followed his brother to the village—and was smitten utterly with her at once.

Strahd lavished Tatyana, a woman more than thirty years his junior, with gifts and attention—but it was Sergei, of an age with Tatyana and still in his prime, who swiftly won her affections. Now, it was Tatyana who visited Sergei as often as he did her, escorted to Castle Ravenloft in a snow-white carriage with gold filigree. 

Each time she did, Strahd welcomed her with the fondness of a suitor—and each time he did, she accepted his warmth with the obeisance of a niece. Slowly, Strahd felt a darkness begin to clutch at his heart, finding his aging reflection more repulsive by the day. Only his pride, tinted with bitterness, stayed his hand from obstructing the young couple’s love.

Tatyana was not the first visitor to walk Castle Ravenloft’s halls, nor the last. As Strahd fumed and longed for her love, he also hosted a number of dignified guests—including Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya and her fool, Pidlwick, further described in <span class="citation">Pidlwick II (p. 235)</span>. Determined to win Strahd’s hand in marriage, the Duchess nonetheless was blind to his infatuation with Tatyana, visiting the castle many times with gifts and stories. Eager to please him, she commissioned the legendary toymaker, Fritz von Weerg, to build a clockwork effigy of Pidlwick, as described in <span class="citation">Pidlwick II (p. 235)</span>, and assigned Pidlwick to train it.

Meanwhile, even as the war against the revenants continued, Strahd soon found his day-to-day agenda full with the management of his domestic affairs. Prince Ariel du Plumette, a distant relative from a branch house of the von Zarovich clan, plumetted to his death as described in <span class="citation">Crypt 4: Prince Ariel du Plumette (p. 86)</span>. Sir Sedrik Spinwitovich, a general who had won his post through nepotism as much as skill, completed the construction of the Barovian navy within the landlocked Lake Zarovich, as described in <span class="citation">Crypt 17: Sir Sedric Spinwitovich (p. 89)</span>. Sir Klutz Tripalotsky, a loyal knight of Strahd's court, perished when he fell on his own sword, and was put to rest within the crypts. (See <span class="citation">Crypt 33: Sir Klutz Tripalotsky (p. 91)</span>.

More significantly, Sergei’s dalliances with Tatyana had begun to impede his priestly duties. Sensing an opportunity—and annoyed at his brother’s negligence—Strahd gave Sergei an ultimatum: end his relationship, or abdicate his position as Most High Priest. To Strahd’s shock and horror, Sergei chose the latter, forswearing his vows as a priest of the Morninglord. Within a fortnight, he and Tatyana were engaged to be married.

Unfortunately for Strahd, a harsh winter soon trapped him in Castle Ravenloft with Sergei and Tatyana, condemning him to suffer endlessly their laughter, stolen kisses, and love-addled gazes. Duchess Dilisnya, a fellow prisoner of the snowdrifts, made her best efforts to bring warmth and good cheer, but ultimately succumbed to a bad bout of pneumonia and was buried beneath Castle Ravenloft. 

Not longer after the snows lifted, Tatyana kindly asked Duchess Dilisnya’s fool, Pidlwick, to remain at Castle Ravenloft—but within a week, the mechanical fool, now named Pidlwick II, secretly murdered the original Pidlwick by pushing him down a flight of stairs. Not long after, it was shut away in a guest bedroom closet, as described in <span class="citation">Pidlwick II (p. 235)</span>.

By mid-spring, preparations had fully begun for the upcoming royal wedding. Sergei asked—and Strahd reluctantly granted—his elder brother’s blessing for the union to come. Even as the revenants’ battles burned on in the lands beyond, the world within the castle’s walls was abuzz with romance and excitement. Only Strahd, tormented by the sight of the happy couple together, felt his spirit sinking ever-deeper into shadow and mirk.
#### Arrival of the Mists
The morning of Sergei's wedding, Strahd gazed into his mirror and realized he had been a fool.

Immortality—the secret of eternal youth—had been within his grasp only three years before. Had he been brave enough—strong enough—to accept it then, Tatyana could have been his. Had he done so mere days before now, she might still have been so. But the hour of the wedding was near, and the vault of the Amber Temple far away.

It was then that a voice spoke to him: a woman’s voice on the surface, but a cacophony of maddened whispers below.

*Time slips through your fingers like the sands in an hourglass,* it whispered. *Yet a chance yet remains to claim what is yours.*

"Who are you?" Strahd demanded. *We are the eternal,* the Dark Powers replied. *The hidden. We are Death—and we may grant what you seek.*

"What must I do?" Strahd asked. "How can immortality be mine?"

*A shard of the tomb of the one you once spurned,* came the answer. *Take it, and be reborn.* A broken shard of amber appeared before him, glinting amidst the shadows.

Strahd reached to take it—but hesitated. "What price must I pay for such a gift?" he asked. "What man can trust Death itself?"

*What man can deny it?* the whispers replied. *The choice is yours.*

Strahd closed his eyes—and grasped the shard. The whispers vanished, and in their place, he felt the familiar presence of the vestige of the Amber Temple. Once again, he felt the entity offer him the dark gift of the Vampyr—the immortality of undeath.

And this time, Strahd accepted.

In an instant, Strahd knew the two conditions he must fulfill to gain the immortality he desired, described in <span class="citation">Amber Sarcophagi (p. 196)</span>. Where once the thoughts might have horrified him, he now accepted them gladly like old friends.

Strahd came upon Sergei in his own royal chambers and slew him with a single blow. With blood on his hands and lips, Strahd found Tatyana in her dressing room and confessed his obsession with her; at long last, he told her, they could be together as they were always meant to be.

Tatyana fled—and Strahd pursued.

He chased her through the gardens of Castle Ravenloft, commanding and pleading with her to stop. At last, he cornered her at <span class="citation">K6. Overlook (p. 54)</span> and begged for her love. Horrified at the monster he had become, and desperate to escape, Tatyana stepped away from him—and felt the thousand-foot chasm beneath the mountain’s cliffs silently waiting behind her.

In that moment, as Strahd stepped slowly forward, Tatyana heard a voice: a woman’s voice, too pleasant and kind for her to notice the cacophony of whispers that lay just below the surface.

*I see your heart,* the voice said to her, *heavy and weeping with fear and despair.*

Tatyana, trembling, whispered, "What can I do? I am trapped, and I cannot bear to be with him."

The Dark Powers replied, *Escape is within your reach, dear one—within the reach of a single step.*

"But the fall," Tatyana said, her voice shaking. "It would surely mean my end."

*An end by stone, or an end by blood,* the voice said sweetly. *The choice is yours.*

With a deep breath, Tatyana leapt—and Death claimed her.

Strahd, enraged and despairing, ran to the edge—but her body had already vanished, swallowed up by the mists of the forest far below. It was there, upon the overlook, that the assassins found him—treacherous castle guards, as described in <span class="citation">The Vampire's History (p. 9)</span>, led by Leo Dilisnya, the son of Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya—and brought Strahd to his death.

But Strahd did not die. His last breath sealed the pact he had made with Death and the vestige alike, and he was reborn as a vampire. In that moment, the Dark Powers took him as their own—and, by the bond that Strahd bore to the land, the land accompanied him. The sky above Barovia turned black, and the Dark Powers spirited the valley away: their first domain of the Mists.

The treacherous guards, terrified of what Strahd had become, fled into Castle Ravenloft through <span class="citation">K23. Servants' Entrance (p. 59)</span>, across <span class="citation">K62. Servants' Hall (p. 76)</span>, and into <span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span>, Strahd's war-room, praying that his loyal guards would slay the beast that their master had become.

Strahd pursued them there, slaughtering dozens of guards—both loyal and traitor alike. The survivors retreated and made their stand in <span class="citation">K70. Kingsmen Hall (p. 79)</span>, while Leo Dilisnya and his most trusted conspirators fled into <span class="citation">K71. Kingsmen Quarters (p. 79)</span>, ascended the stairs to <span class="citation">K20. Heart of Sorrow (p. 59)</span>, and exited the secret entrance into <span class="citation">K34. Servants' Upper Floor (p. 64)</span> before escaping into the courtyards once again. By the time Strahd had finished his slaughter, Dilisnya was gone—fled across the drawbridge and lost in the mountains.

Katarina, still serving as a maid in the castle, came upon Strahd amidst the slaughter—and, for reasons he did not fully understand, Strahd left her in peace. She fled from him, escaping the keep as screams echoed behind her, and never looked back.

Finally, covered with blood, Strahd exited Castle Ravenloft and saw his parents’ faces in the thunderclouds, as described in <span class="citation">The Vampire's History (p. 9)</span>. Along the borders of Barovia, the Dark Powers raised the Mists: impenetrable walls that imprisoned all who would cross them. 
### The Dark Era (352 BC–599 BC)
#### Aftermath of the Wedding
Katarina sought refuge with a Vistani encampment at Tser Pool, too fearful of Strahd to seek shelter elsewhere. There, she prayed for a means to free her half-brother from the fate that had befallen him and to liberate her people from the death he embodied—and a voice answered.

That evening, Katarina forged a pact with the Seeker, the sole surviving spirit of the forsaken Ladies Three. She traded her youth for the power to undo Strahd's evil, transforming into Madam Eva: an ageless crone and avatar of the Seeker, endowed with magical foresight. Alone in a Vistani tent, Madam Eva delicately manipulated the threads of Fate, bracing herself for the burden of years to come.

By nightfall, Strahd's heart was consumed by fury, hatred, and grief. He preserved Sergei’s corpse using the magic he had mastered, then set out to hunt down the treacherous guards. With eyes sharper than a hawk's, a nose stronger than a wolf's, and ears keener than a bat's, he pursued them through the darkened woods, extinguishing their lives one by one like candle flames. Each time he killed, he fed voraciously, draining their blood like a drunkard indulging in wine.

As dawn approached, only Leo Dilisnya, the mastermind of the conspiracy, still eluded him. Bloated with blood, but his thoughts still in chaos, Strahd returned to the castle. He descended to the carnage he had unleashed in the cellars below, only to find dried husks— the soldiers' corpses, drained of all blood.

Instead, an enormous blood-red human heart hovered at the pinnacle of the dark and empty tower, looming far above the killing grounds. Forged of shattered crystal and as tall as a man, it stood as an unholy monument to Strahd's first victims: the Heart of Sorrow, described in <span class="citation">K20. Heart of Sorrow (p. 59)</span>.

As Strahd surveyed the wreckage of his former nobility, the revenants of the Order of the Silver Dragon marched towards Castle Ravenloft, determined to understand why Strahd's death had not freed their spirits. Upon arrival, they encountered Madam Eva, as described in <span class="citation">The Order of the Silver Dragon (p. 129)</span>, who informed them of Strahd's fate. Hearing this, Vladimir Horngaard halted his advance and led his knights back to Argynvostholt.

Strahd eventually returned to the chamber where Sergei's corpse and possessions still lingered. Whether it was grief, wistfulness, or a mere impulse that moved him to pick up the *Brightblade*, Strahd couldn't be certain. All he knew was that, as the sun's rays shone from his father's crystal blade, they scorched him with an unimaginable pain. He threw the weapon aside, his skin seared with burns, and howled in both agony and rage.

Slowly, time resumed its flow for Strahd. However, adjusting to his new state proved difficult. Discovering that his reflection no longer appeared in the castle's mirrors, he ordered them removed and stored in <span class="citation">K11. South Archers' Post (p. 57)</span>. As the bloodthirst rose within him, he attempted to quench it first with animals, then criminals. Beast's blood brought no nourishment, however, and the keep's dungeons quickly emptied of prisoners.

Reluctant yet driven by hunger, Strahd turned his attention to his maid, Varushka—who chose to take her own life, as described in <span class="citation">Tormented Spirit (p. 68)</span>. 

As her body was buried, scouts returned with ill tidings: the edges of the valley had been engulfed by an impassable mist, confounding to those who passed through, and deadly to those who lingered.

By now, only a remnant of the castle’s original staff remained, driven by loyalty, fear, or a combination of both. Strahd found a stableboy among them and ordered him to prepare his horse, Beucephalus, for departure from the keep. Too terrified to refuse, the stableboy stammered that the stallion's coat had darkened with the skies, and now a demonic fire blazed upon its mane and fueled its temper.

The stableboy spoke true. Gone was Beucephalus, the Wonder-Horse, a stallion fit for an emperor. In its place was a **nightmare**, a demon that burned with rage and spite. (See <span class="citation">Crypt 39: Beucephalus (p. 93)</span>.) Strahd found the demonic steed fitting for a creature such as himself and rode forth from the castle to the Amber Temple, determined to seek a means of escaping his fate.

It was in the archives of the Amber Temple that Strahd learned his new name. "Vampire," the books called him, an enemy of the sun and its blessed light. But the sun had not shone upon the valley since his transformation days earlier, the skies remaining dark and overcast.  Strahd couldn't help but wonder if it was a blessing to be granted respite from the light he once knew, or a curse, to endure without it.
#### Ghosts of the Past
Eager to put Tatyana out of his mind, Strahd lured more women to the castle in rapid succession, taking several of them as brides before draining their lives and turning them into vampire spawn. Rahadin, his ever-faithful chamberlain, ensured that Strahd’s victims were made comfortable during their stay, as described in <span class="citation">Rahadin (p. 236)</span>. The first of these was a woman named Sasha Ivliskova, who Strahd would later seal in a crypt beneath Ravenloft after tiring of her. (See <span class="citation">Crypt 20: Sasha Ivliskova (p. 89)</span>).

By the time a month had passed since Strahd’s transformation, Patrina had learned of Tatyana’s death and Strahd’s terrible curse. Though taken aback by his decision to accept the Vampyr's dark gift, she saw an opportunity within her circumstances. She returned to Ravenloft to win Strahd’s heart—and Strahd accepted her offer of marriage with amusement. 

Before they could be wed, however, Kasimir Velikov, Patrina’s brother, learned of their plot. Helpless to keep her from Strahd, but determined to thwart the vampire’s plans, he rallied the dusk elves to stone her to death. In response, Strahd demanded her body—which he sealed in the castle crypts—and sent Rahadin to punish her killers, as described in <span class="citation">Kasimir Velikov (p. 232)</span> and <span class="citation">Rahadin (p. 236)</span>.

When news of the dusk elf massacre reached Saint Markovia’s ears, she knew that she could wait no longer. Markovia rallied her followers and declared holy war on Castle Ravenloft—and when Strahd sent a group of vampire spawn to the Abbey, destroyed them with contempt.

Determined to complete her crusade, Saint Markovia led her followers to Castle Ravenloft, where she battled Strahd as described in <span class="citation">Saint Markovia's Thighbone (p. 222)</span>. Strahd slayed her and her followers, and sealed her remains in the crypts below Ravenloft.

Though unsuccessful, Markovia’s attack had left Strahd wounded and emptied the castle of most of its remaining staff. Adamant that a keep should lack neither guards nor attendants, Strahd raised the corpses of his former guards as **wights** and set them to patrolling the castle.

Fearful that a future revolt might find and raise Sergei’s *Brightblade* against him, Strahd then journeyed to Khazan’s tower at Lake Baratok and commissioned the archmage to destroy it. Though Khazan’s apprentice stole, then lost the sword’s hilt, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed, as described in <span class="citation">Sunsword (p. 223)</span>.

When news of Markovia’s death reached its walls, the clerics of the Abbey sealed it off from the outside world, terrified of Strahd’s reprisal. Meanwhile, near Yester Hill to the south, a vision of Strahd’s homeland appeared in the Mists, as described in <span class="citation">Y5. Wall of Fog (p. 200)</span>.

Determined to distract himself from the visions in the mist, Strahd terrorized the clerics of the Abbey, preying upon their paranoia and fear. It was’t long before the the clergy began to fight amongst themselves; within weeks, all were either dead or insane, as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 8: The Village of Krezk (p. 143)</span>.

In the darkened halls of Argynvostholt, quarrels rang out amongst the revenants of the Order as Vladimir’s knights demanded vengeance for Saint Markovia. Vladimir, however, crushed their dissent, determined that Strahd should suffer his accursed fate for all of eternity. Awoken by their discord, the ghost of Argynvost began to haunt his ruined lair—too weak to speak out, but strong enough to mourn.
#### Strahd’s First Followers
By now, word had spread of Strahd’s transformation and the valley's isolation. Not all reacted with fear, however. In the village of Barovia far below, Elisabeth Durst found herself spellbound by the news from the castle, following Strahd’s descent with admiration and awe.

All was not well in the Dursts’ home. Gustav Durst, Elisabeth’s husband, was rumored to be having an affair with the family’s nursemaid, Klara, described in <span class="citation">15. Nursemaid's Suite (p. 215)</span>. Elisabeth dismissed the claims; they were baseless accusations, she said, born from jealousy of her husband’s wealth and success. She chose to ignore the steady growth of Klara’s stomach, their fleeting glances, and the hours they spent alone. It was nothing, she told herself—and, for a time, she believed it.

That changed when she discovered a shard of amber within a shipment of grain delivered from their mill to the west. The mysterious gem seemed to beckon her, captivating her senses and sparking an inexplicable fascination. She kept it, storing it in the jewelry box in <span class="citation">12. Master Suite (p. 214)</span>, where she admired it each night.

From that moment, something within her shifted. No longer could she bear the sight of Klara’s pregnant figure or ignore the whispers and shared glances between her and Gustav. Denial turned to suspicion, then paranoia and rage. Slowly, Elisabeth’s bitterness simmered, building in fury until she could bear it no longer.

When the maid's bastard son, Walter, was born, Elisabeth snapped. She took a carving knife from the kitchen and ambushed Gustav in their bedroom, killing him. With blood still dripping from the blade, she went to Klara’s suite, where she found the nursemaid asleep and her baby resting in its crib.

Elisabeth first bound Klara's limbs to the bed with rope and twine, then murdered the child where he lay. As Walter’s blood stained her knife, she prayed to Death that his infant soul would be damned—and Death listened.

From her jewelry box, Elisabeth felt the amber shard calling to her. She picked it up, and for the first time, heard its voice. It offered her the power to conceal her husband’s untimely death, to torment his mistress, to bind Walter’s spirit, and to secure a family truly faithful to her. She agreed—and accepted the dark gift of the vestige within.

With its aid, Elisabeth summoned Walter’s soul from the Mists and bound it to his tiny corpse. The undead child had a ravenous hunger, and, over the following days, she gleefully mutilated his mother’s body, feeding him fingers, toes, eyes, and teeth. However, she made sure to keep Klara alive, prolonging her vengeance.

As Walter fed, he grew, transforming into a misshapen aberration of flesh. Meanwhile, in the twisted labyrinth of her own mind, Elisabeth found solace in nightly prayers to Strahd, whom she perceived as the source of the power that sustained her.

Slowly, she gathered a group of like-minded followers to do her bidding, using her newfound power and Walter’s monstrous strength to keep them in line. The cult made sacrifices to Strahd on an altar deep underground, worshipping him as a messiah sent by the powers of darkness. They feasted on the organs of those that they killed, and fed the carcasses to the ever-hungry Walter. 

Rose and Thorn, haunted by the ghastly sounds below, begged their mother to end their nightmares. Elisabeth ignored them at first, but when the sight of their faces—painful reminders of her late husband’s blood—became too agonizing to bear, she locked them in their attic bedroom and left them to starve.

Elisabeth’s fixation with Strahd only grew. She saw in him a kindred spirit, and yearned to unite with him. On the first anniversary of Barovia’s entry into the mists, she led her cult to visit Castle Ravenloft, eager to pledge their devotion in exchange for a promise of immortality. But Rahadin, on Strahd’s orders, turned them away instead, delivering a letter dismissing Elisabeth and her ambitions. The cult withdrew to the Durst house in despair, where Elisabeth’s worship soured to rage and despair.

Months passed, and the cult’s members began to depart. Through the eyes and ears of her remaining followers, Elisabeth came to learn that a group of outsiders—adventurers—had entered Barovia, spirited to the valley by the will of the Mists. She also came to learn that Strahd had encountered them on two occasions—occasions that, by all accounts, he had seemed to take pleasure in.

Jealous of Strahd’s attentions and determined to draw his eye, Elisabeth lured the adventurers to her home, where they were captured and killed atop the cult’s bloody altar. She had intended their murder to be a sacrifice to Strahd’s glory—but she had no knowledge that Strahd, bored and hungry for fresh blood, had intended those outsiders to be his own prey. 

Enraged by her interference, Strahd slew her and the entirety of her cult. Their spirits, however, lived on in the haunted foundations of the house, serving Mrs. Durst’s final wish to find and capture a worthy sacrifice to Strahd’s glory—and so win his affections at last. 
#### Passage Into History
Ten years passed, and the land of Barovia sank deeper into darkness and despair. Khazan—now in his waning years, and feeling the weight of his impending mortality—visited the Amber Temple and discovered the secret to becoming a lich. When he had completed the transformation, he traveled to Castle Ravenloft to challenge Strahd for the rulership of Barovia. Instead, Strahd persuaded him to serve as an advisor in matters of magic—a proposition that Khazan, to his own surprise, accepted.

Since he had become a vampire, Strahd’s own magical progress had slowed to a trickle; where mortals could wield their life force as a means of channeling the arcane, he had been forced to find other, less efficacious means. With Khazan’s aid, though, Strahd’s studies began to advance once more.

Together, they developed a spell that would preserve Sergei’s body for eternity, and built a tomb whose splendor would never fade. Sergei was buried there in his gleaming armor, with the *Sigil of the Sun* around his neck. They built arcane traps to defend Strahd’s tomb and castle, including the <span class="citation">Teleport Traps (p. 85)</span> of the catacombs, the gargoyles of <span class="citation">K8. Great Entry (p. 55)</span>, and the wyrmling statues of <span class="citation">K7. Entry (p. 54)</span>.

Strahd learned also to imbue his armor with permanent spells and a sliver of his being, creating <span class="citation">Strahd’s Animated Armor (p. 227)</span>. Meanwhile, he delved deeper into the secrets of necromancy; as an amusement and a challenge, he created **Strahd zombies**—foul creatures both stronger and more horrible than the ordinary undead.

But as time stood still for the immortals of Castle Ravenloft, its sands continued to flow for those in the valley beyond. The once-loyal retainers and vassals of the von Zarovich line began to pass into death—Artimus, the castle’s architect; General Grislek, Strahd's most trusted commander; Prefect Ciril Romulich, high priest of the Morninglord; and countless others. Strahd found each one when they died and sealed their corpses in places of honor in the catacombs beneath Ravenloft, as described in <span class="citation">K84. Catacombs (p. 85)</span>.

One life yet eluded him, however: Leo Dilisnya, the traitor. Through his spies, though, Strahd soon discovered that Lovina Wachter had discovered Leo’s location. To avoid causing alarm, Strahd disguised himself as a human nobleman and journeyed to the Wachter manor in Vallaki. There, he introduced himself under the pseudonym of Vasili von Holtz, claiming to be an envoy from Ravenloft.

With Lovina’s aid, Strahd tracked Leo to the darkened corridors of the Abbey of Saint Markovia. As they climbed the path from Krezk below, Lovina, whose family had been slaughtered by the traitorous guards on the day of Sergei’s wedding, asked that Leo be denied the mercy of a quick death. “Vasili” agreed to her request, and asked her to remain outside while he confronted him.

Strahd defeated Leo with contemptuous ease. Instead of killing him, Strahd transformed Leo into a vampire spawn and, with Lovina’s approval, entombed him in a mausoleum beneath the Wachter’s manor. Without access to human blood, Leo would slowly starve to death, his sanity eroding over the decades.

Lovina agreed that on when Leo died, her descendants would remove the flesh from Leo's bones and hide them away, preventing his resurrection. Years later, Strahd sent Lovina the letter described in <span class="citation">N4q. Storage Room (p. 114)</span>, signed “Vasili” to maintain his disguise.

Elsewhere, facing an eternity of confinement in Barovia, Khazan became determined to find an escape. He sought the secrets of demilichdom at the Amber Temple but destroyed himself in the process, as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 11: Van Richten's Tower (p. 167)</span>. Strahd, mourning the loss of a fellow immortal, sealed Khazan’s skull and staff in <span class="citation">Crypt 15: Khazan (p. 88)</span>. The lich’s spellbook, however, was nowhere to be found.
#### The Decades Pass
Forty years after Tatyana’s death, Strahd encountered Marina Ulrich: her first reincarnation. However, before he could turn her into a vampire spawn, the Mists spoke to her as they had once whispered to Tatyana, and promised her an escape from Strahd’s clutches—if only she would allow her father to discover the vampire’s nightly visits. 

Driven to desperation beneath layers of Strahd’s hypnosis, Marina accepted the Dark Powers’ offer—and was soon killed as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 10: The Ruins of Berez (p. 161)</span>. Strahd erected <span class="citation">U5. Marina's Monument (p. 164)</span> in her memory, and condemned her father’s guilt-ridden spirit to haunt <span class="citation">U2. Ulrich Mansion (p. 162)</span>. Over the course of the coming centuries, Strahd would chase Tatyana’s spirit again and again; each time, the Mists would speak sweet words of sanctuary—and her soul would once more slip from his fingers.

By the time of Marina’s death, the Martikov family—the descendants of the druids who had once owned the Wizard of Wines winery—had assimilated among the Barovian people, with a goal of reclaiming their birthright. After earning a small fortune through the secret use of their **wereraven** lycanthropy—as messengers, knowledge-brokers, and everything in-between—the Martikovs arranged a marriage between their eldest son and one of the Krezkovs’ daughters. 

Fifteen years later, when the reigning Krezkov patriarch passed away, the Martikovs made sure that his will bequeathed the winery to his daughter, who now bore the Martikov name and was secretly a **wereraven** herself. Though the business was now once again truly theirs, the Martikovs kept good relations with the Krezkovs by making regular deliveries of wine, free of charge—a practice that would continue for centuries to come.

As the Martikovs reclaimed their vineyards, the witch Baba Lysaga claimed the swamp that Berez had become as her new home, as described in <span class="citation">Chapter 10: The Ruins of Berez (p. 161)</span>. She built <span class="citation">U3. Baba Lysaga's Hut (p. 163)</span> atop the stump of an enormous tree, and erected the <span class="citation">Goat Pen (p. 162)</span> outside of <span class="citation">U2. Ulrich Mansion (p. 162)</span>. She found herself drawn to the latent power of the nearby Swamp Fane at <span class="citation">U6. Standing Stones (p. 165)</span>; when the storm giant Deceba, the mate of Elder Burebis, confronted her, Baba Lysaga killed her and took her head, from which she crafted her <span class="citation">Giant Skull (p. 163)</span> magic vehicle.

Meanwhile, Strahd found himself intrigued by a new arrival to his keep: a mage by the name of Ludmilla Vilisevic, who had sought him out seeking the secrets of immortality. 

Unlike Elisabeth Durst long ago, Strahd was impressed by Ludmilla’s cunning, ambition, and aptitude for the arcane arts.  Strahd made Ludmilla his vampiric bride and commissioned her to serve as his chief advisor on matters of magic, given Khazan’s absence.

Decades passed, and the last remnants of Strahd’s humanity faded with them. By now, he had been undead far longer than he had ever been alive; any romance, nostalgia, or regret he had once possessed had long since vanished from his hollow heart.

In this time, Strahd learned that the Mists that entrapped him and his land would occasionally bring outsiders into the valley: playthings for him to torment and entrap. He found himself looking forward to these interruptions from the monotony of unlife, savoring each moment of the games that he played before his toys inevitably snapped.

Those opportunities, however, were few and far between, with years or even decades passing between them. Bereft of lands or people to conquer, Strahd grew melancholic, withdrawing to his coffin for weeks, then months at a time, spending his solitude in a state of slumbering torpor until his servants awoke him.

When not hibernating, Strahd continued to seek entertainment wherever he could find it. He took on two new brides: Anastrasya Karelova, a Vallakian noblewoman who delighted him with her cunning and wit; and Volenta Popfsky, a Barovian courtesan whose cheerful sadism was matched only by her innovative spirit. Anastrasya assumed authority over Strahd’s vast network of spies, while Volenta built traps and gruesome installations across Castle Ravenloft, including <span class="citation">Flight of the Vampire (p. 61)</span>, the floating skeletons of <span class="citation">K26. Guards' Post (p. 61)</span>, the armor traps on <span class="citation">K19. Grand Landing (p. 58)</span>, and the <span class="citation">K67. Hall of Bones (p. 78)</span>.

One hundred and eighty years after Barovia’s isolation, a **deva** named Lumiel was sent from the Upper Planes to honor Saint Markovia’s memory. Lumiel took up residence at the Abbey of Saint Markovia and called himself the Abbot. He reopened the abbey and began tending to Barovia’s sick, but—with Strahd's influence—ultimately fell from grace and descended into madness. (See <span class="citation">The Abbot (p. 225)</span>.)

The Abbot’s arrival, however, reminded Strahd of the world that lay beyond the Mists, inspiring him to renew his efforts to escape. On a whim, he visited the Vistani fortuneteller Madam Eva and bade her to read his future. When Madam Eva, however, foretold the coming of a Grand Conjunction—a time, more than a century in the future, when the borders between worlds would grow thin, and the Mists would touch the Material Plane—the fragile light of hope reignited within Strahd’s blackened heart.

Decades prior, Strahd had learned that the Heart of Sorrow—the invulnerable crystal heart that hovered at the peak of Ravenloft’s tallest tower—represented the bond between himself and the Mists, which allowed him to control others’ passage in and out of the valley even as he himself proved unable to leave. Now, he returned to the Fanes of Barovia, where he bound their power ever-closer to his own. 

In doing so, he channeled their energies into the Heart, laying the foundations for a weapon that, on the eve of the Grand Conjunction, would carve a hole through the Mists for Barovia’s escape. He told no one of his grand designs—not even Rahadin, his faithful chamberlain—fearful that speaking it aloud would invite interference.

When the plan was complete, however, Strahd found little else to retain his attention. Impatient to see the fruits of his labors and weary of his subjects, he retired to his tomb for a final hibernation: one that would last a hundred years. The Devil Strahd vanished from public view—and, as he slumbered, the Heart of Sorrow slowly grew in power, devouring the energies of the land itself.
### The Dormant Era (600 BC–735 BC)
#### Echoes of Evil
Though Strahd slept in Castle Ravenloft, his children and servants remained active in Barovia. Without their master to restrain their appetites, dozens of Strahd’s surviving vampire spawn dispersed across the valley, beginning a reign of terror that made the streets run red with blood.

Lugdana, a paladin of the Morninglord, took up arms to defend her people. With the aid of burgomaster Ismark Antonovich and the **wereraven** Livius Martikov, she uncovered the secret history of the long-lost *Sigil of the Sun*, an ancient artifact that could aid her in her quest.

It was Livius who discovered that the *Sigil of the Sun* lay in the crypts of Castle Ravenloft, and Livius who stole it while Lugdana and Ismark kept the castle’s guards distracted. With Lugdana wielding the sigil’s power, the trio began a campaign to root out and destroy nests of vampires scattered across Barovia, inspiring renewed faith in the Morninglord’s glory wherever they went. 

Unwilling to reveal that the power to resist Strahd’s creatures had come from the Devil’s own castle, but determined to give his people something to believe in, Ismark told the masses that an angel in the form of a raven had delivered the sigil to them—and so it became known as the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind.* 

Grateful for Ismark’s honor, and inspired by their adventures alongside Lugdana, Livius Martikov founded the Keepers of the Feather: a secret society of **wereravens** who would aid and assist the good-hearted heroes of Barovia. Membership was small, at first, limited to Livius’s own family—but as time passed, their ranks began to grow.

By the time of Lugdana’s crusade, Baba Lysaga had begun to recruit a coven of witches from amongst the exiles and forsaken of Barovia. However, twenty-five years after Lugdana had first claimed the *Holy Symbol*, many of Baba Lysaga’s faithful had grown resentful of the swamp-mother’s tireless dedication to Strahd. With the vampire asleep in his castle, the youngest among the coven had no living memory of his power or authority and no desire to serve his name or legacy.

The strongest among them, a witch who called herself Baba Zelenna, secretly founded the Cult of Chernovog: a fiendish cult that venerated the demon prince Chernovog and sought to summon him into Barovia to overthrow Strahd. The cult assembled at the Forest Fane at Yester Hill, seeking to use its power for their own ends. Together, they broke Strahd’s bond to the sacred fane and began the ritual that would summon Chernovog, known also as the Green God, to wreak havoc across the valley.

With the weight of years upon her shoulders, Lugdana was now far from the days of her prime. Ismark, named “Ismark the Great” for his feats of bravery, had perished in a heroic fight defending the people of his village years before. Lugdana and Livius went alone to Yester Hill to do battle with the coven and Chernovog.

The demon prince was fearsome, but the *Holy Symbol* and the Keepers’ aid balanced the scales. With a mighty blow, Lugdana felled Chernovog and dispelled his spirit—but sustained a wound that soon cost her her life. In the chaos, the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* was lost, vanishing once more amidst the sands of time.
#### A New Generation
Three years after Lugdana’s death, in a land far beyond the valley, Rudolph van Richten was born. 

By the time he was twenty-eight, he was a successful doctor and husband, married to his childhood sweetheart, Ingrid. Across the Mists, in the land of Barovia, Livius Martikov’s grandson Davian became the proud father to Urwin, Davian’s first-born child. 

Not far from the Martikovs' winery, in the town of Vallaki, the sixteen-year-old Fiona Wachter ran away from home following an explosive argument with her parents and brother. She found herself in the Old Svalich Woods, where the witch Baba Lysaga found her. 

Lysaga led Fiona to the ruins of old Berez and allowed her to become a member of her witch's coven. There, Fiona learned of Mother Night, of Strahd's legacy and curse, and of the secrets of magic, though she struggled to hear, as Baba Lysaga called it, "the voice of Mother Night." 

Six months later, however, upon learning that her parents and brother had died in a tragic accident, Fiona chose to return to Vallaki against Lysaga's will. Though Fiona secretly took her grimoire of magic with her, Baba Lysaga banished Fiona for her decision, barring her from returning to Berez ever again.

Fiona returned to take command of Wachterhaus, her family's estate. As she wept and prayed in her parents' former bedroom, a voice spoke to her—identifying itself not as Mother Night, but as Ezra, goddess of the Mists. Fiona accepted the voice's counsel eagerly, ignorant of its nature as a mere mask of the Dark Powers.

Six years later, Rudolph van Richten's son, Erasmus, was born. However, when Erasmus was fourteen, the young Vistana Ezmerelda d’Avenir watched in horror as her parents, joined by the members of the Radanavich Vistani caravan, kidnapped Erasmus and sold him to the vampire Baron Metus. 

Rudolph tracked down and interrogated Ezmerelda's parents before departing to find his son, but was too late, losing not only Erasmus, but Ingrid as well.  (See <span class="citation">Ezmerelda d'Avenir (p. 231)</span> and <span class="citation">Rictavio (p. 238)</span>.) Rudolph destroyed Metus in fury, and took up a life of hunting monsters—and vengeance against the Vistani.

For three years, Rudolph traveled in search of the Vistani who had wronged him. As he did, he passed through the territory of a lich and was followed by a horde of voracious undead, as described in <span class="citation">Journal of Rudolph van Richten (p. 254)</span>. When he finally came upon the Radanavich clan, he released the undead swarm upon them, declaring, "Undead take you as you have taken my son!”

The horde killed all but one young man: Arturi Radanavich, who hid away in a trunk until Rudolph and the monsters had gone. The leader of the Radanavich clan, the Vistana seer Madam Irene Radanavich, cursed Rudolph as she died, as described in <span class="citation">Journal of Rudolph van Richten (p. 254)</span>. Ezmerelda d’Avenir and her parents, however, survived unaware of the massacre, having departed from the Radanaviches’ company mere weeks before. 

That same year, in Barovia, Izek and his younger sister, the four-year-old Ireena Strazni, were attacked by a **dire wolf**, as described in <span class="citation">Izek Strazni (p. 231)</span>. Izek lost his arm, and Ireena fled. She would later appear near the Village of Barovia with no memory of her past, where she would be adopted by Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich. (See <span class="citation">E5f. Chapel (p. 46)</span>. 

Izek soon lost his parents to grief, as described in <span class="citation">Izek Strazni (p. 231)</span>, and lashed out at those around him—eventually killing several other children. He was caught and pardoned by Vargas Vallakovich, the adult son of Baron Valentin Vallakovich. Against his father's wishes, Vargas took Izek into their home. Vargas's wife, Lydia Petrovna, was disturbed by the boy’s violent proclivities and withdrew to care obsessively for the their newborn son, Victor.

Six years later, while ransacking a household that had failed to pay its taxes, Izek—now Vargas's loyal enforcer—found an amber shard tucked away in a forgotten box. The vestige from whence it came spoke to Izek in his dreams, promising him the power to demand respect, authority, and status. That night, in the attic of the Baron's mansion, it gifted Izek with a fiendish limb that could conjure fire, as described in <span class="citation">Izek Strazni (p. 231)</span>. 

Izek was seen, however, by Baron Valentin Vallakovich. A deeply religious man, Valentin condemned Izek for his blasphemy and vowed to cast him out of the Vallakovich household. Instead, Izek suffocated him with a pillow, savoring the Baron's slow, quiet death. Unbeknownst to Izek, Valentin's son, Vargas, observed the entire interaction. Rather than intervene, however, Vargas chose to do nothing, both out of hatred for his father's abuse and from Vargas's own narcissistic ambitions.

Vargas became Baron, and Izek his right hand. Not long thereafter, Izek began to dream of Ireena and commissioned the toymaker Gadof Blinsky to craft toys that resembled her. (See <span class="citation">Izek Strazni (p. 231)</span> and <span class="citation">Creepy Toys (p. 118)</span>.)

Meanwhile, at the Wizard of Wines, Danika Dorakova, a **wereraven** and agent of the Keepers of the Feather, became pregnant with the child of Urwin Martikov, her sweetheart and beau. Alarmed by their romantic dalliances, their families betrothed them at once to ensure that the child would not be born out of wedlock.

Shortly before the wedding, however, a Vistana—acting at the behest of Madam Eva—secretly stole one of the three magic gems from the winery’s fields while Urwin was on watch, ending its production of Champagne du Stompe. Madam Eva foresaw that the theft would bring discord to the Martikov family and drive Urwin to Vallaki, where he would one day assist and guide heroes who could defeat Strahd and return sunlight to Barovia.

Madam Eva’s foretelling proved prescient. As described in <span class="citation">Chapter 12: The Wizard of Wines (p. 173)</span>, Davian blamed Urwin for the theft, leading to a bitter fight. Urwin and Danika departed the winery altogether for Vallaki, where they purchased a run-down tavern and renamed it the Blue Water Inn. The inn soon became a haven for the members of the Keepers of the Feather, who expanded their operations in Vallaki and extended their spy network. 

Not far away, in the Vistani encampment just outside of Vallaki, the Vistana Luvash became the proud father of Arabelle—an unknowing descendant of Madam Eva’s blood.

Months later, Ezmerelda, now a young woman, ran from home in search of Dr. Van Richten. Two years passed before she finally found him, becoming his apprentice as described in <span class="citation">Ezmerelda d'Avenir (p. 231)</span>. Their companionship lasted for two more years, after which they parted ways after months of infighting. Less than a year later, a werewolf bit off Ezmerelda’s right leg following a rescue mission gone wrong, sidelining her for months while she commissioned an artisan to craft a prosthetic. 

Back in Barovia, the young Victor Vallakovich found an old spellbook in his father’s library—the lost spellbook of the lich Khazan—and began to teach himself magic. That same winter, Nikolai Wachter, the husband of Lady Fiona Wachter, died of illness, breaking Fiona’s heart. Meanwhile, the last elders of the Vallakian Vistani encampment passed away, leaving Luvash—and his younger brother Arrigal—in charge of the caravan.
#### Strahd’s Return
Two years after Nikolai Wachter’s death, Dr. Van Richten came to learn the terrible truth of the Vistani curse that haunted him. Maddened with rage, he became determined to seek vengeance upon the Vistani people for the deaths of those he had lost across the years. He was saved, however, by the return of Arturi Radanavich—the sole survivor of Van Richten’s massacre two decades before.

Unbeknownst to Van Richten, the words he had spoken to unleash the undead horde had cursed Arturi, driving undead to pursue him wherever he went. Arturi, exiled from the Vistani caravans, sought Van Richten’s aid to lift this curse—and offered a chance to lift Van Richten’s in turn.

Together, the two men spent a year among the Vistani: Arturi, the exile, and Van Richten, the enemy. Van Richten learned their ways, came to know their people, and slowly released the hatred that had gripped his heart. When the year came to an end, Arturi and Van Richten became blood-brothers, forgiving one another the sins of their pasts and lifting their curses.

Finally at peace, Van Richten retired to his home accompanied by a parting gift from Arturi: a mischievous monkey named Piccolo. However, as Van Richten prepared to document his life’s work, he recalled that Strahd von Zarovich—the greatest vampire of all—still lurked within Barovia like a shadow beneath the land. 

Van Richten’s research confirmed that Strahd still slumbered in the catacombs of Ravenloft, but he knew that the vampire would not remain vulnerable forever. Determined to see the task done before his last years were upon him, Van Richten prepared his tools one final time and set off through the Mists.

Six months later, Van Richten—now disguised as a traveling scholar and accompanying a caravan of Vistani—arrived in the quiet village of Barovia. The burgomaster, a man named Kolyan Indirovich, welcomed him as an honored guest, and Van Richten settled in to gather intelligence and prepare his attack.

Two weeks after Van Richten’s arrival, however, disaster struck. A massive undead **dire wolf**—the beloved pet of Strahd’s bride Anastrasya Karelova—attacked a group of Barovian children who had strayed too far from the village. Van Richten, luckily nearby, fended off the beast and destroyed it, freeing the children with nary a scratch.

It was ill luck, however, that the beast’s attacks knocked off Van Richten’s *hat of disguise*, revealing his true appearance. It was worse luck still that the priest’s son—a young man named Doru who had been looking for the children himself—recognized Van Richten’s face, tools, and fighting style from *Van Richten’s Guide to Vampires*, a well-worn tome that Doru had read countless times since purchasing it from a Vistani caravan. That evening, Doru confronted Van Richten, demanding to confirm his true identity.

Cornered, Van Richten reluctantly did so—and an awestruck Doru posed an ambitious and audacious plan. A fierce devotee of the Morninglord’s sacred texts and an amateur swordsman, Doru was determined to lead an army against Castle Ravenloft and return sunlight to Barovia. With Dr. Rudolph van Richten at their helm, Doru believed their righteous fight would surely be victorious.

Van Richten attempted to dissuade him—but Doru was unconvinced. Proud and zealous, Doru demanded the right to accompany Van Richten to Castle Ravenloft to destroy the vampire Strahd. To force the old man’s hand, Doru vowed to gather his friends and neighbors and set off for the castle in the morning—with or without Van Richten’s aid.

Realizing that Doru’s crusade would see his companions destroyed—and risk awakening Strahd regardless—Van Richten reluctantly agreed to accompany them, if only to ensure that their lives were not spent for naught. He exacted from Doru a promise to depart in two days’ time, rather than one, giving him additional time to prepare. Doru also agreed to conceal Van Richten’s true identity, calling him by the alias “Alanik Ray” to avoid alerting Strahd’s servants.

As Van Richten readied himself for the journey, Doru raised the cry of revolution. By the day of reckoning, he had gathered a mob of two-dozen hopeful young Barovians to march upon the keep, promising to restore the light of the sun to the dreary valley. Ismark Kolyanovich, a skilled swordsman and the son of Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, remained behind, concerned of the consequences should the village be undefended.

As Van Richten had feared, though Doru’s efforts proved worse than fruitless: Instead of killing Strahd, the mob only awoke him from his hibernation. Stirred from his slumber, Strahd massacred the Barovian invaders, sparing only two: Escher, a talented bard who confessed a fascination with Strahd and the dark power of immortality; and Doru himself. 

As Van Richten fled from the castle for <span class="citation">Chapter 11: Van Richten’s Tower (p. 167)</span>, Strahd turned both Escher and Doru into **vampire spawn**. He kept Escher to amuse him as a consort and cupbearer, and—after forcing “Alanik’s” true identity from his lips—sent Doru back to Barovia to bring terror to its people.
### Strahd's Awakening (735 BC–Present)
#### Master of Castle Ravenloft
Displeased with the weakening of his rule while he had slept, Strahd summoned his minions to Castle Ravenloft and ordered them to restore his authority over the land. He also directed them to hunt down Dr. Van Richten, as described in <span class="citation">Find Rudolph van Richten (p. 10)</span>. The castle’s servants, Lief Lipsiege and Cyrus Belview, proved grateful to finally have a proper lord to serve.

Meanwhile, Strahd interrogated Rahadin to confirm the current date—and was relieved to learn that the time of the Grand Conjunction had not yet passed. Rahadin, knowledgeable of Strahd’s tells, inquired as to the reason behind Strahd’s concern—and Strahd shared with him the secrets of the Fanes, the Heart of Sorrow, and the coming Grand Conjunction.

Their conversation was overheard, however, by the **banshee** of Patrina Velikovna, described further in <span class="citation">Crypt 21 (Patrina Velikovna) (p. 89)</span>. Eager to seize Strahd’s power for herself, and seeing an opportunity to manipulate circumstances in her favor, Patrina contacted Kasimir in his dreams as described in <span class="citation">Kasimir Velikov (p. 232)</span> and <span class="citation">K9a. Kasimir’s Hovel (p. 121)</span>.

As his minions prepared to execute his bidding, Strahd gave Rahadin a critical task: announcing the Devil's return to Castle Ravenloft. Rahadin rode forth from the keep with haste and delivered his proclamation first to Barovia. As punishment for their treason, he told them, the village of Barovia alone would face Strahd's wrath, giving them ninety days to make peace with their gods.

Rahadin rode next to Vallaki and Krezk, sharing the news of Strahd's reawakening. In response, a terrified Baron Vargas Vallakovich closed Vallaki's gates to outsiders, and began hosting weekly festivals in an effort to drive out the Devil's influence.

Shortly after Rahadin's warning, many of the villagers of Barovia proposed an exodus to Vallaki, where they could take shelter behind the town's fortified walls. However, when Ismark Kolyanovich gave a rousing speech invoking the memory of Lugdana and Ismark the Great, most decided to remain in the village to defend their homes. Only a few Barovians—two dozen at most—gathered up their belongings and fled on the Old Svalich Road.

Upon their arrival, however, Baron Vargas Vallakovich refused to allow the Barovian refugees entry, fearful that they were cursed by Strahd’s wrath. With news of the vampire’s return ringing in his ears, the Baron instead enacted a series of iron-fisted laws, clamping down on “malicious unhappiness” and mandating attendance at the “festivals” that he now considered the keys to Vallaki’s salvation.

Not far away, in the village of Krezk, the Abbot felt Strahd’s return, and became determined to see the vampire’s curse lifted. (See <span class="citation">The Abbot (p. 225)</span>.) The Abbot directed two of his attendants, the **mongrelfolk** Otto and Zygfrek Belview, to begin scouring the village’s cemeteries for human remains.

Meanwhile, the darkness and despair spread by Strahd’s revival drew the attention of Morgantha, a **night hag**, and her two daughters, Bella Sunbane and Offalia Wormwiggle. The coven, drawn to Barovia like moths to a flame, took up residence in <span class="citation">Chapter 6: Old Bonegrinder (p. 125)</span> and began selling <span class="citation">Dream Pastries (p. 125)</span> to the Barovian refugees outside of Vallaki. Hoping to keep apprised of Castle Ravenloft’s doings, Morgantha bestowed her coven’s *hag eye* upon Cyrus Belview, as described in <span class="citation">K62. Servants’ Hall (p. 76)</span>.

Concerned that the Barovian werewolf pack had forgotten its ancient fealty to him, Strahd closed the valley's borders to them and sent **dire wolf** emissaries to confirm their loyalty once more. Emil Toranescu, the pack's alpha, privately schemed to betray Strahd's pact and escape through the mists—until Kiril Stoyanovich, a younger and more ambitious werewolf, betrayed him in turn. Strahd locked Emil in the castle dungeons, and Kiril took control of the pack in his stead.
#### The Darkened Valley
Two weeks now had passed since the failed revolt, and Strahd began gathering hordes of undead to serve his wrathful will. Upon learning of his dark designs, the revenant knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon demanded that their commander, Vladimir Horngaard, release them from their vows and permit them to warn and defend the village. 

Enraged by their defiance, Vladimir banished his knights from the mansion and commanded them to secrecy, allowing only Sir Godfrey Gwilym to remain.

Not long thereafter, Kasimir Velikov, investigating the secrets of the Amber Temple at Patrina's direction, visited the now-empty manor of Argynvostholt and spoke with Sir Godfrey. Though  Godfrey warned him to avoid the darkness that lay within the temple, Kasimir did not leave empty-handed, finding amidst the rubble an ancient map that bore the temple's location.

As Kasimir prepared to climb the slopes of Mount Ghakis, Victor Vallakovich and Stella Wachter—the children of Baron Vallakovich and Lady Fiona Wachter—activated a prototype *teleportation circle*, dreaming of escaping Strahd's tyranny. The circle malfunctioned, however, and the psychic backlash tore Stella's soul from her body. Enraged by Stella's fate, Lady Wachter began recruiting a cult to depose the Vallakovich clan.

In Krezk, the Abbot completed a prototype of his own: a monstrous **flesh golem**, which he set to patrolling <span class="citation">S15. Madhouse (p. 151)</span>. He swiftly began work on his next project: a masterpiece to serve as Strahd's final bride.

As the Abbot's grave-robbing intensified, Kasimir attempted to reach the Amber Temple, but was turned back by the **vrocks** of Tsolenka Pass at <span class="citation">T2. Demon Statues (p. 157)</span>. Wounded and despondent, Kasimir returned to the dusk elves’ settlement to ponder his next move.
#### The Wrath of Strahd
Ninety days after Rahadin's proclamation, Strahd's undead army was finally complete. He unleashed the zombie horde against the village of Barovia—and, to punish Doru, sent him to the Barovian church to torment his father, Father Donavich.

The zombies’ siege of the town lasted a full week, with the undead crashing against crude village fortifications night after night. Though the village was ultimately secured, dozens of lives were lost—including, on the final night, the life of Burgomaster Indirovich himself. With that, Strahd finally withdrew his forces, allowing the Barovians to heal their wounded, gather their dead, and attempt to rebuild.

The burgomaster’s children, Ismark and Ireena, took charge of the rebuilding effort. Even so, many Barovians, fearful of Strahd’s emergence and the threat of Castle Ravenloft, left their ruined homes and broken families and fled for Vallaki to the west, hoping that its high walls could bring security. 

Many of those who remained in the village of Barovia turned on Ismark, blaming him for dissuading them from fleeing for safety weeks before. Ismark—named for his ancestor “Ismark the Great”—was now mocked as “Ismark the Lesser.”

Two nights after the siege ended, visiting the village in disguise to assure himself of its submission, Strahd caught a glimpse of Ireena in the streets—and recognized her as the spitting image of Tatyana Federovna. 

The following night, believing Ireena to be Tatyana’s latest reincarnation, Strahd visited the burgomaster’s manor and charmed his way inside before biting her. Two nights later, he visited again, overcoming Ismark and Ireena’s best efforts to resist him and biting Ireena a second time. Desperate and defiant, the two siblings placed heavy fortifications around the manor—all while doing their best to keep Strahd’s visitations hidden from the other villagers. 

Now, as Strahd’s servants spread themselves across the valley, obedient once more to the vampire’s will, a creeping darkness is returning to corrupt the land. Shadows lurk in every corner, and the Mists watch silently as the horrors unfold. 

Meanwhile, in a distant land far beyond the valley, several travelers arrive in the town of Daggerford, blissfully unaware of the trials that await . . . 
## Strahd von Zarovich
### Roleplaying Strahd
Strahd is cold and calculating, skilled in social manipulation and deception. As the adventure unfolds, his attitude toward the players shifts significantly. Though Strahd never conceals his nature or identity, this dynamic relationship manifests as three "roles" that he plays: the Gentleman, the Tyrant, and the Monster.
#### The Gentleman
When the players first enter Barovia, Strahd acts as the Gentleman—polished and poised, if somewhat sociopathic. He is welcoming, well-mannered, and insatiably curious. His goal—to learn the ins and outs of the players' minds, including their goals, strengths, and weaknesses.

As the Gentleman, Strahd should flatter the players with his interest and curiosity, offend them with his arrogance and condescension, and disgust them with his disregard for human freedom.

In this role, Strahd most often feels curious, amused, nostalgic, or disappointed. Consider channeling Hannibal Lecter (*The Silence of the Lambs*), Don Corleone (*The Godfather*), or Frank Underwood (*House of Cards*) when playing him.

The Gentleman avoids clashes as much as he can, taking any player rudeness or defiance in stride. If pushed, he might send his minions to stop a player's physical attacks, but only as a last resort.
#### The Tyrant
When he learns that the players have relit the beacon of Argynvostholt at the conclusion ***Arc R: The Beacon of Argynvostholt***, Strahd becomes the Tyrant—harsh, stern, and somewhat cruel. He keeps his cool and aloof demeanor, but treats the players less like guests and more like disappointing protégés. His goal—to push the players to their limits, testing their resilience and assessing their competence.

As the Tyrant, Strahd should offend the players with his insults and condescension, and disgust them with his disregard for human life.

In this role, Strahd most often feels disappointed, scornful, satisfied, amused, and contemptuous. Consider channeling Moriarty (*Sherlock*), Tywin Lannister (*Game of Thrones*), Severus Snape (*Harry Potter*), and Omni-Man (*Invincible*).

The Tyrant never strikes first—but will dare defiant players to back their words with action. Should a player back down, Strahd mocks their resolve and capabilities. Any players who attack him, though, are met with a swift and ruthless response—though never a lethal one.
#### The Monster 
When he first learns that the players have restored the blade of the *Sunsword* in ***Arc V: The Sunsword***, Strahd abandons all pretense and becomes the Monster—a cold, unfeeling sociopath, described further in **Roleplaying Strahd** (p. 10). His goal—to achieve his goals, no matter the cost.

As the Monster, Strahd should disgust the players with his complete indifference to life and death, inspire pity for his inability to feel happiness or love, and frustrate the players with his refusal to ever lose his cool.

In this role, Strahd most often feels indifferent, curious, satisfied, and determined. Consider channeling Stan Edgar (*The Boys*), Gus Fring (*Breaking Bad*), and Thanos (*Avengers: Endgame*).

The Monster crushes any resistance ruthlessly and efficiently. Though he can't be provoked, he's too proud to ever flee from a fight.
### Strahd’s Relationships
Strahd has a complex web of relationships with the denizens of Barovia, many of which are described below.

***Death House.*** Strahd views the cult of Death House with respectful disdain; he finds their methods and obsessions distasteful, but appreciates their efforts to bring worthy consorts and adversaries from the lands beyond the Mists.

***Village of Barovia.*** Strahd believes, without romance or obsession, that Ireena Kolyana’s body is the host for Tatyana’s soul, and that Tatyana’s soul belongs to him. Through his spies, he is aware of Ismark Kolyanovich’s position and relationship to Ireena, but finds him to be a lackluster leader and a half-rate swordsman. He views Donavich and Doru with scorn, disdaining the convictions, pride, and faith that Doru had in life.

***Tser Pool Encampment.*** Strahd finds Madam Eva a fascinating enigma, but has come to an unspoken understanding with her: she shall read his fortune whenever he requests it, and, in exchange, he will not delve too deeply into her history or affairs.

***Old Bonegrinder.*** Strahd is aware of the **night hag** coven’s presence, but has little interest in their affairs.

***Town of Vallaki.*** Strahd has no interest in Baron Vargas Vallakovich, but, through his spies, believes him to be a bumbling fool. He finds Lady Fiona Wachter to be a useful agent and favors her for her family’s history of loyalty, but cares little for her obsession with Vallakian politics. He is aware of the existence of the Keepers of the Feather (though not that the Blue Water Inn serves as their meeting-place), but does not view them as a significant threat. 

***Vistani Encampment.*** Strahd holds Arrigal as one of his favored spies. However, he pays little mind to the dusk elves—Kasimir especially—and has little interest in their affairs.

***Argynvostholt.*** Strahd views the **revenants** of the Order of the Silver Dragon with disinterested contempt, but has long since determined that the knights pose no threat to him, and has largely ignored them as a result. He has heard the rumors that Argynvost’s spirit haunts the manor, but pays them no mind; he would refuse to believe that the beacon of Argynvostholt could be relit even if told to his face.

***Wizard of Wines.*** Strahd is aware that the winery is a stronghold for the Keepers of the Feather, but does not view them as a significant threat. He has delegated their “discipline” to Ludmilla, ensuring that their insubordination and resistance will be properly punished.

***Yester Hill.*** Strahd views the Forest Folk with disdain and some amusement. He finds their maddened worship to be more grating than gratifying, and views the modern generation as a poor shadow of their more distinguished forebears. He does find them to be useful tools, however, and knows that their “faith” is a necessary evil to ensure their continued loyalty.

***Village of Krezk.*** Strahd has little interest in Baron Dmitri Krezkov or the people of Krezk. He is, amused by the Abbot’s descent into madness and corruption. He intends to temporarily “play along” with the Abbot’s efforts to construct a **flesh golem** bride for him, but has no serious intention of accepting Vasilka when complete.

***Werewolf Den.*** Strahd finds Kiril Stoyanovich to be a useful and loyal servant, if somewhat brutish and unsophisticated. He intends to keep Emil Toranescu, the pack’s former alpha, as a prisoner in his dungeons until Emil is sufficiently mad with starvation to be “tamed.”

***Tsolenka Pass.*** Strahd is peripherally aware that the Mountain Folk roam the Balinok Mountains, but—due to Elder Burebis’s protection—is unaware of the existence of their settlement Monsdav. He considers the Mountain Folk to be a lost and broken people and has no use for or interest in them.

***Amber Temple.*** Strahd respects Neferon’s dedication to protecting the temple and finds him to be a worthy guardian of the treasures contained within. He has historically had a collegial respect for Exethanter, but, after awakening from his own hibernation, was disappointed by Exethanter’s loss of memory—something Strahd has little interest in restoring.

***Castle Ravenloft.*** Strahd is amused by the efforts of his brides—Ludmilla Vilisevic, Anastrasya Karelova, and Volenta Popfsky—to placate and impress him. He is momentarily entertained by his newest consort, Escher, but has been distracted lately by other, grander designs. He views Rahadin as his most loyal, trusted, and favored servant, but spares little mind to the other staff and occupants of the castle, including Cyrus Belview, Lief Lipsiege, the coven of witches, and his own vampire spawn. By contrast, Beucephalus is his favored “pet” and most valued tool.
### Strahd’s Goals
Strahd’s primary goal is simple: to free himself and Barovia from the Mists.

As a conqueror, Strahd craves new lands and the freedom—and power—to claim them. He seeks to restore his long-lost empire, with Castle Ravenloft and the valley of Barovia as its seat of power.

To this end, he needs three things: a pacified kingdom, a host of loyal servants, and—most importantly—an escape plan. 

By defeating his servants and halting their schemes, the players can deny him the first; by defending Ireena Kolyana and resisting his temptations, they can also deny him the second. However, Strahd has plans within plans, and there is only one way to halt his final scheme: to destroy the vampire himself.
#### Reclaiming the Valley
When Strahd awoke from his century-long slumber, he found that much had changed. 

The people of Barovia had forgotten why they feared him, and their burgomasters no longer served him faithfully. His servants and consorts had dispersed across the valley in pursuit of their own schemes and whims, and the wilds themselves had somehow cleansed the stain of corruption.

That, he knew, must be addressed.

He moved quickly to reclaim the Forest Fane as his own, restoring its bond to the Heart of Sorrow once more. He bade Rahadin to find staff and attendants for Castle Ravenloft, and to ensure that each of the keep’s occupants served their master’s will. And he summoned his brides and spawn to Castle Ravenloft, commanding them to spread his shadow across the valley once more.

Since then, Strahd has broken the village of Barovia and brought the werewolf pack to heel. He seeks next to break the town of Vallaki and the village of Krezk, to discipline the so-called “Keepers of the Feather,” and to capture the vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten. 

When his servants’ work is done, Strahd expects to look down from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft upon a faithful and fearful populace, its people subservient to the Devil of Castle Ravenloft once more.
#### Renewing His Servants
When Strahd awoke from his slumber, he found that many of his vampiric brides and other servants had dispersed across the valley, forgoing his dark will in favor of their own petty pursuits. He has quickly moved to correct this—but some doubts still remain.

Strahd seeks assurances that, when he escapes Barovia, he will do so with an army that will heed his words and execute his will without error or hesitation. To this end, he has delegated many of his plots to reassert his authority to his servants. Should they succeed, they shall be exalted and placed in positions of authority beneath him; should they fail, they shall be locked in the crypts beneath Ravenloft for eternity.

Strahd is always hungry for new talent, however, and is on the lookout for new generals to serve his conquests and fresh consorts to keep him entertained. When the players arrive in Barovia, he focuses his attention on those who are especially charismatic, arrogant, intelligent, cunning, or attractive, seeking to determine whether any among the party are worthy of serving him in undeath. 

Though Strahd has not said so expressly, his brides are well-aware of the risk of being replaced—a motivation that he hopes will fuel their efforts on his behalf. 
Strahd believes fully in the “survival of the fittest” and expects to see the strongest rise to the top.
#### Escaping the Mists
With Madam Eva’s reluctant guidance, Strahd has learned that the Grand Conjunction—a time when the barriers between worlds will be thinned, and the energies of the stars aligned—is a prime opportunity to free himself from the Dark Powers’ prison. 

To this end, Strahd has crafted an ambitious and dangerous ritual to escape the Mists, using the Heart of Sorrow as its conduit and anchor. This ritual has three necessary components: a power source, a control mechanism, and a catalyst.

***The Power Source.*** Strahd’s plan requires a substantial amount of power—far more than he can supply himself. So long as he remains bonded to the Fanes of Barovia, however, he can channel their power directly into the Heart of Sorrow for use in the ritual. 

Using the Fanes in the ritual will also allow Strahd to bring the valley itself—and all of its inhabitants—along with him to the Material Plane. Given that Barovia was his final conquest and the centerpiece of his power, Strahd will not relinquish it so easily.

***The Control Mechanism.*** The raw power of the leylines beneath the Fanes is wild and near-impossible to control. Even as their master, only a token of the Ladies’ divinity can allow Strahd to direct them. He has recently learned that a child with the blood of the Seeker resides somewhere within the valley—the Vistana Arabelle, though Strahd does not yet know her name—and has directed his spies to locate and capture her. 

Should this plot fail, Strahd must instead journey to the Whispering Wall at Yester Hill and make a sacrifice of great personal value—his **animated armor**, the symbol of his early conquests and might—exchanging a piece of his past for a promise of his future.

***The Catalyst.*** Power and control are all well and good. In order to break through a wall, however, all good conquerors need a point of attack. To this end, Strahd plans to forge a battering ram capable of piercing through the Mists—a siege weapon forged from the souls of the Barovians themselves.

The Mists, as creations of the Dark Powers, are born of apathy, fear, and despair. To escape the Mists without drawing their ire, therefore, Strahd intends to surround the Heart of Sorrow with a shell of wailing, hopeless souls. He believes that, by brutally reasserting his dominion over Barovia, his subjects will lose themselves to fear and despair, darkening their souls to meet his needs.

By consuming the Barovians’ souls, Strahd can also use the energies of his escape to repurpose their soulless husks as undead soldiers, forging a new army for his conquests to come. The sole exceptions include Ireena Kolyana and Dr. Rudolph van Richten, who Strahd will allow to keep their souls for his own purposes.

***Plans Within Plans.*** If the players reconsecrate the Fanes, Strahd quickly devises a backup plan. By becoming the champions of the Fanes, the players will unknowingly have made themselves into conduits for their power, allowing Strahd to access the Fanes’ energies if he can lure the players to Castle Ravenloft. 

He can do this by using the power stored in the Heart of Sorrow to plunge Barovia into eternal night, raising the deceased from their graves and sending a plague of undead against Barovia’s settlements—a siege that will end only if Strahd himself is defeated. As a bonus, Strahd believes that this undead apocalypse will surely drive the Barovians into fear and despair, counteracting the players' efforts to bring hope to the valley.
### Strahd’s Allies
Strahd commands a vast host of beasts, undead, and other minions, which he can direct in a host of plots or schemes. They include:

* ***Rahadin,*** Strahd’s dusk elf chamberlain
* ***Beucephalus,*** Strahd’s **nightmare** steed
* ***Strahd’s vampiric brides,*** Ludmilla, Anastrasya, and Volenta
* ***Strahd’s vampire spawn,*** including his consort, Escher
* ***Undead servants,*** including **zombies**, **Strahd zombies**, and **wights**
* ***Loyal beasts,*** including Barovian bats, rats, wolves, and **dire wolves**
* ***The werewolf pack*** commanded by Kiril Stoyanovich
* ***Vistani spies***, including Eliza (at Tser Pool Encampment) and Arrigal (at the Vallaki encampment)
* ***The witches’ coven*** that dwells in Castle Ravenloft

However, Strahd **always faces the final battle alone.** Whether by pride, fate, or mere coincidence, this fight is his to win—or lose.
### Strahd’s Tactics
Even in combat, Strahd is no ordinary foe. Like several of the enemies encountered in this adventure, he uses a **multi-phase statblock** in battle. Strahd’s statistics work as follows:
##### Phases
Strahd's combat statistics include three phases: the Mage, the Soldier, and the Vampire. Each phase has its own unique features, abilities, **and an independent pool of hit points.** (For example, damage dealt to the Soldier phase doesn’t carry over to the Mage phase.) 

Strahd can choose which phase he begins in when rolling initiative. By default, his starting phase is the Mage.

When outside of combat, Strahd can:

* switch into his Solder phase by drawing his longsword and extinguishing his focus;
* switch into his Mage phase by lighting his focus (his cloak's ruby clasp) and stowing his longsword;
* switch into his Vampire phase by stowing his longsword and extinguishing his focus.
##### Phase Transitions
When a phase is reduced to 0 hit points, Strahd’s statistics are immediately replaced by the statistics of another phase (your choice). **When this happens, all conditions afflicting Strahd end.** (For example, if Strahd was prone or paralyzed, he is no longer prone or paralyzed.) Damage dealt to one phase does not carry over to the next.

By default, Strahd's second phase is the **Soldier**, and his third phase is the **Vampire**. When Strahd enters his second phase, his eyes glow crimson red and his fingernails lengthen and harden. When Strahd enters his third phase, his fangs grow longer and sharper, and his nostrils become batlike slits.

A phase reduced to 0 hit points can’t be used again until Strahd completes a long rest in his coffin.
##### Defeat
If all three phases are reduced to 0 hit points, Strahd transforms into a cloud of mist instead of falling unconscious, provided that he isn't in running water or sunlight. **If he can't transform, he is destroyed.**

While transformed in this way, he has a fly speed of 30 feet, can hover, and has immunity to all damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight. He must reach his coffin within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his coffin, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After 1 hour in his coffin with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point.
##### Attributes & Weaknesses
All three phases share the following vampire attributes and weaknesses:

* *Undead Nature.* Strahd doesn't require air.
* *Forbiddance.* Strahd can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
* *Chained to the Grave.* Strahd cannot gain the benefits of a long rest except by resting in his coffin for eight consecutive hours between dawn and dusk.
* *Children of the Night.* Strahd can comprehend and verbally communicate with Barovian bats, rats, and wolves (including **dire wolves**), which obey his commands.
* *Stake to the Heart.* If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Strahd’s heart while he is incapacitated in his coffin, he is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

Additionally, Strahd can use the following action in his ***Vampire*** form:

* ***Shapechange.*** If Strahd isn't in running water or sunlight, he polymorphs into a Tiny **bat**, a Medium **wolf**, or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged. Anything he is wearing transforms with him, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies. While in mist form, Strahd can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and he is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight.

While Strahd retains a connection to the Fanes of Barovia, he also possesses the following features in all three phases:

* ***Dominion of the Mountain.*** While Strahd retains the power of the Mountain Fane, he is under the effect of a permanent *nondetection* spell. Additionally, Strahd can cast *control weather* as an action without components.
* ***Dominion of the Swamp.*** While Strahd retains the power of the Swamp Fane, he can cast *major image* and *move earth* without components.
* ***Dominion of the Forest.*** While Strahd retains the power of the Forest Fane, he can cast *beast sense*, *locate creature*, and *animal shapes* without components.
* ***Rejuvenation.*** If Strahd is destroyed while he retains the power of at least one of the Fanes, he gains a new body in 24 hours, regaining all his hit points and phases and becoming active again. His new body appears within his coffin.

> [!info]+ **Vampiric Forbiddance**
>
> When deciding whether and how Strahd's ***Forbiddance*** feature applies, use the following definitions:
>
> A **residence** is a place of residence that is not generally open to the public, including houses, apartments, cabins, and even certain types of rooms within a larger building, like an inn or church, provided they are used for living purposes and offer some degree of privacy. The definition does not include public places like taverns, shops, streets, or town squares.
>
> An **occupant** is an individual who expects to reside in the dwelling indefinitely, or a guest of such an individual. This person must have some claim to the space, such as by being a homeowner, renter, tenant, or guest of one of the aforementioned.
>
> Remember that an occupant charmed by the ***charm*** ability of Strahd’s Vampire phase will gladly invite him to enter if asked.

<p><strong><em>Father of the Night.</em></strong> A humanoid killed by Strahd’s <strong><em>bite</em></strong>, or which is reduced to 0 hit points by it and dies without regaining consciousness, arises as a <strong>**vampire spawn**</strong> under Strahd’s control at the start of his next turn.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (1/Day).</em></strong> If Strahd fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Strahd makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack. Strahd can replace one of his attacks with a <strong><em>charm.</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>Unarmed Strike.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: <span class="highlight">+11 to hit</span>, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> <span class="highlight">10 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage</span>.

<p>A target that can't see Strahd automatically succeeds. While charmed, the target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected; it isn't under Strahd's control, but takes his requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Strahd bite it.</p>
<p>The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the target is still charmed at the end of the minute, the effect lasts for 24 hours, until Strahd is destroyed, or until he takes a bonus action to end it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Predator’s Fury.</em></strong> Strahd summons a pair of wolf-like shadows from his cloak and chooses up to two creatures he can see within <span class="highlight">60 feet</span> that are within 5 feet of each other.
